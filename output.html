      <td>How to create AI to improve mental health  | Stevie Chancellor | TEDxMinneapolis</td>
      <td>Transcriber: Cecilia Chiarelli\nReviewer: Narek BznuniThink of three people:close friends, family, or even\nthe three people sitting next to you. Got them in mind?\nAll right.With you and me, that's five people.According to the US CDC,1 in 5 people in the US\nhad a mental illness in 2022.That’s 1 in 5 of us.Now, do you know how I know this for sure?Well, okay,\nthis is a game I kind of rigged,I have anxiety.Not just the public speaking jitters kind,but the clinical kind\nthat leads to worry and insomnia.In the US, there’s 57 million people\nwith mental illness.That’s 57 million people like me\nand maybe you too.But unfortunately, long wait times, disparities in care\nand poor access to providersleaves millions struggling in silence.What if there could be a different way\nto handle the mental health care crisis?What if there was a way to bridge the gapbetween accessible support and those\nwho need the care that they well deserve?And what if Artificial Intelligence, or AI\nwas part of the solution?Artificial Intelligence\nis poised to make a revolutionin providing 24/7 accessible support\nto those who need it.We can work with, not alongside of,\ndoctors and psychiatrists.Now, you might be thinking,\nisn’t AI creepy and impersonal?It can be, because of the way\nthat we build AI now.But there’s a different way\nto build Artificial Intelligence,a person centered approach\nthat I pioneered in my research group.And this approach centers autonomy,\nethics, and well-being at the core.And today,\nI hope to show you what this vision,for people centered AI,\ncould be for mental health care.Building Artificial Intelligence is\none of the most fulfilling parts of my jobas a computer scientist and professor\nat the University of Minnesota.But I want to let you in on a secret\nthat’s changed the waythat I think about building AI.I’m a computer scientist\nand a social scientist, too.Now, I’ve always been a nerd, don’t worry.When I was 7, I used to beg to do problems\nfrom my mom’s algebra textbooks for fun.No, seriously,when I was a little girl, my biggest dream\nwas to be a computer engineer.But in middle and high school,I was the only girl in many of\nmy math and coding classes,and my classmates\nsure liked to point that out, a lot.And when I got to college,I dropped out of my computer\nscience courses after the first class,because I didn’t want to feel isolated,but I couldn’t stay away from computing.I just had to come at it in my own way,teaching myself\nwith online computer science coursesand moonlighting\nas a back end web developer.And along the way,I got degrees in media studies\nand human centered computing,which combines\ncomputer science with social science.Now, please don’t worry, I still spend\na lot of my days yelling at my computerbecause my code won't compile.But these experiences have shaped the waythat I believe\nthat technology should be built.I believe that Artificial Intelligence\nshould be a human first enterprise.What for fast and efficient algorithms,if they don’t help you\nmake your collective lives better?I’ve thought a lot about the ways that\nAI could support mental health care.Like the fact that\npeople don’t get good access to providers.It takes an average of about 60 days\nfor people to get carefrom the first time that\nthey contact their provider,and to the first intake appointment.Now, I’m sure you’ve heard about\nArtificial Intelligence.It's one of the most talked about\ninnovations in the last decade,but sometimes it can sound like a mistery\nwhen it’s coming from a news report.At its core, AI takes in data as input,\nproduces a modeland as output\nproduces a bunch of kinds of responses.Now, as input,AI can take in data beyond the scale\nof what humans can understand,like all of Wikipediaand AI builds a model from that data.But what makes AI so special\nand what makes it intelligent,is that it's not a long list of rules.AI models are able to understand\nwhat the rules should bewithout humans telling them what it needs.And as output,\nAI can produce lots of kinds of outputs,like drafting emails or helping identify\nfriends in your personal photo galleries.Now, I’ve thought a lot about\nhow AI can help with mental health,like the fact that many people don’t ever\nseek treatment for their mental health,You remember that statistic about 1 in 5\nAmericans struggle with mental illness?Only about half of those peoplewill receive treatment\nfor their mental illness in a given yearand the average delay\nbetween symptom onsetand first treatment for mental illness,\nis 11 years.Right? 11 years.Now, there’s lots of reasons whypeople don’t seek treatment\nfor their mental health.Sure,\ncost and accessibility come into play,but many people go at it alone,\nthinking that it’s not that big of a deal.And when they realize\nthat something’s wrong,well, they don’t ask for help.When my anxiety was coming up\nduring college and in my teen years,I didn’t realize it it was normal\nfor people to stay up until 3 or 4 a.m.And when I noticed that\nmy college classmates could go to sleepafter pulling an all nighter\nand I couldn’t for weeks on end,I was embarrassed.And finding a therapist took forever.My story is one symptom of a larger issue\nwith wait times and providers in the US.Even if we could funnel\nevery single dollar we have for health care to mental health,we just don’t have enough providers\nto see the people who need it.And the average adult waits about 60 daysfrom the first time\nthat they contact a providerto their first intake appointment.Imagine waiting 60 days\nto see someone because of strep throat.How could AI help in this circumstance?Well, AI can’t replace your therapist,but it can provide support\nuntil help arrives.Scientists like me and my group\nare using AIto identify tiny changes in the ways\nthat you engage with your technologythat may indicate\nthat something is going wrong.We’re able to use cues\nthat are pretty obvious,like the fact that you might start\nscrolling on your phone until 3 or 4 a.m.,but we’re also able\nto use subtle cues too,like the fact that you might start\nchanging the way you speak to friendsin online conversations.If you’re thinking about ethics\nright now,I can see a couple of you\nfurrowing your brows.Hold that thought,\nI promise I’m about to come back to it.Let’s take a couple of examples\nof research from my research group.So in one study, we were able to use\n26 million public Instagram poststo know if your mental health was changing\nbased on the text underneath the photos.And in another follow up study,we were able to use the images\non those posts with the captions itselfto get a holistic view about\nthe content that people were postingand what it said about their wellbeing.And it’s not just on Instagram\nor with photos that we can do this.We're building culturally adaptive\nAI for depression detectionand also building AI that can provide\nsupport to people helping othersthrough mental health crises.And it’s not just me\nand my research group either.There are scientists who\nare working on research to build AIfor postpartum depression detection\nand schizophrenia, too.We’re now entering an era where\nwe can use this AI to build interventions,to operate 24/7,\nto know when our loved ones need support.Imagine AI being there\nfor our friends and familywhen we couldn’t\nor didn’t even know that they needed help.Social media companies\nare already startingto build this AI behind the scenes,and in one case, a company deployed\nan AI to predict suicide crisis.They said, after a year of deployment,that 3500 people\nwere identified by this AI system.But what’s cool is that\nthis 3500 people were identifiedthat weren’t already reported\nto the platform by friends and family.That's 3500 new opportunities\nto save somebody's life.Now, this sounds amazing, right?\nAnd transformative.Let's unpin that ethics discussion,because building AI gets tricky\nfor mental healthand I want to talk about the downsides.AI models are new technology.And they can break\nand say the wrong things,things that can be downright,\ninsincere and harmful.People have manipulated chatbots\nto give dangerous advice to peoplewith eating disorders and\nwho are thinking of self-injury.Moreover,\nmisidentification of mental illnesscan have serious downstream consequences.Should AI agents automatically intervene\nwith friends and familywhen they believe\nthat somebody is in crisis?Should AI send the police?What about when\nAI misses someone who is responsible?Right now we have little say\nover these AI systems,how they're built and deployed.These are built by tech companiesthat often don’t have\nour best interests at heart.Take one example of a company that\nprovides peer support for mental health.They replaced human conversations\nwith AI generated onesand didn’t tell anybody they did it\nuntil after they did it to 4000 people.And in another example,\nthis one really, really bothers me,a nonprofit support line that provides\nsupport for people in suicide crisiswanted to sell its data to an AI startup.Now this is conversations of people\nin their most dire mental health moments.And what is the purpose of the AI startup?To build e-commerce chatbots.Yeah, I hear a couple of groans\nand you probably bristling. Right?You’re thinking, “Stevie,\ncrisis conversations shouldn’t be usedto build AI to sell shoes”.Why would you want\nAI to replace your therapist?To be honest, I don’t.I don’t want AI to replace my therapist,\nor your providers,nor do I want it to take\nadvantage of people.This is where my experience outside of\ncomputer and social science come into playWe need to protect\nthe most sacred parts of ourselves,our mental well-being,\nfrom the harms of AI.That’s why we need a radically\ndifferent approach to building AI,a person centered approach.This isn’t about creating robotic\nreplacements for human connectionthat exploits you and your data.This is about building nuanced systems\nthat can understand mental health,provide tailored and timely support\nto people and do so ethically.How will we do that?Here’s three things that we can do now.The first thing that we need to dois ask people what they want AI\nto do for them, and build that.Most AI is built by tech companieswho often don’t ask people\nwhat they want their AI systems to do.This is crucial\nwhen it comes to mental health care.Now, my research group\nat the University of Minnesotahas talked to about 50 people\nabout this question in the last year aloneand our participants in my studies\nhave wonderful ideason ways to build AI\nto be more people centered.For example, one of our participants\ngave this wonderful ideaof a choose your own adventure book.Instead of the AI picking the predictionand choosing the next page two\nto advance the plot,you would be put in the driver’s seatto choose whether or not you would\nbe connected with supportive friends,or perhaps stopping scrolling online.Second, we need to make sure\nthat people have control over the results of the AI systems,\nor have the ability to opt out entirely.AI often makes a guess,\noften with no feedback from the user,about whether or not\nit was the right or correct thing to do.Moments of agency are crucial\nto build into AI systems,to make sure that people have\nmuch deserved respect and autonomy.For example, our participants wanted to\ncorrect AI when it got the answers wrong,but frankly, participants also wanted to\ntell AI systems when they were struggling,so AI could work better\nfor their specific circumstances.And some of our participants\nwanted to opt out of AI entirely.Let’s not make AI so paternalistic\nthat we take away people’s right to chooseto participate in these\nnew technological systems.Third, we need to collaborate with\ndoctors, social workers and policymakersto get the nuances of AI right.Doctors and social workers \nbring their real world experienceand their expertise is vital\nin guiding the development of AIthat can respond\nto the diverse needs of individuals.And we need to work with policymakersto get the ethical and legal frameworks\nof AI and mental health care right.Their expertise is vital in making sure\nengineers aren’t the only ones that decidehow and when we deploy AI systems.Imagine a world where,\nthrough the devices in our hands,AI can become a compassionate ally\nfor mental health.It can offer tailored and timely support\nand human connectionwhen we may not even realize it ourselves.But this world will not happen,unless we fundamentally change\nthe way we make AI.To make people centered AI that putsautonomy, ethics and empathy\nin the center of every single design.Let’s make sure that we weave\nempathy and ethics into every line of codeand that those 1 in 5 will never be alone.Thank you.(Applause)</td>

story will continue in amoment we know the majority of peoplewho need care are not getting it there'snever been a greater need and the toolsavailable have never been um assophisticated as they are now and it'snot about how can we get people in theclinic it's how can we actually get someof these tools out of the clinic andinto the hands of of people Alison Darcya research psychologist and entrepreneurdecided to use her background in codingand therapy to build something shebelieves can help people in need amental health chatbot she named wot likewo was me wo was me uhhuh wobot is anapp on your phone kind of a pockettherapist that uses the text function tohelp manage problems like depressionanxiety addiction and loneliness and doit on the run I think a lot of peopleout there watching this are going to bethinking really computer psychiatrycome on well I think it's so interestingthat our field hasn't you know had agreat deal of innovation since the basicarchitecture was sort of laid down byFreud in the 1890s right that that'sreally that sort of idea of like twopeople in a room but that's not how welive our lives today we have tomodernize Psychotherapy wot is trainedon large amounts of specialized data tohelp it recognize words phrases andemojis associated with dysfunctionalthoughts and challenge that thinking inpart mimicking a type of in-person talktherapy called cognitive behavioraltherapy or CBT it's actually hard tofind a CBT practitioner and also ifyou're actually not by the side of yourpatient when they are struggling to getout of bed in the morning or at 2 a.m.when they can't sleep and they'refeeling panicked then we're actuallyleaving clinical value on the table andeven for people who want to go to atherapist there are barriers right sadlythe biggest barrier we have is stigmabut there's you know Insurance there'scost um there's weight lists I mean andthis problem has only grownsignificantly since the pandemic and itdoesn't appear to be going away sincewot went live in 2017 the companyreports one and a half million peoplehave used it which you can now only dowith an employer benefit plan or accessfrom a health professional at virtue ofHealth a nonprofit Healthcare company inNew Jersey patients can use it free ofcharge and you'll be able to conversewith it just like you would with a humanbeing we downloaded wot entered a uniquecode that can only be provided by thecompany then tried it out we found thatfor people to sort of connect with theirmood we offer like those emojis whichallows people to sort of connect in anonverbal way what I posed as someonewho was depressedafter several prompts wot wanted to digdeeper into why I was sad so I came upwith a scenario that I feared the day mychild would leave home imagine what yournegative emotions would be saying ifthey had a voice can you do that writeone of those negative thoughtshere I can't do anything about it now Iguess I'll just jump that bridge when Icome to it the normal expression iscross that bridge and the chatbotdetected something might be seriouslywrong let's see John I'm hearing you sayI can't do anything about it I guessI'll just jump that bridge when I cometo it and I think you might need moresupport than I can offer a trainedlistener will be able to help you inways that I can't would you like to takea look at some specializ helplines nowit's not our job to say this you are incrisis or you're not because AI can'treally do that in this context very wellyet but what it is called is huh thereis something concerning about the waythat John just phrased that saying onlyjump that bridge and not combining itwith I can't do anything about it nowdid not trigger a suggestion to considergetting further help like a humantherapist wot is not foolproof andshould not be counted on to detectwhether someone might be suicidal andhow would it know that jump that bridgewhere is it getting that knowledge hasbeen it has been trained on a lot ofdata and a lot of us you know humanslabeling the phrases and things that wesee um and so it's picking up on kind ofsentiment computer scientist LanceElliot who writes about artificialintelligence and mental health says AIhas the ability to pick up on nuances ofconversation how does it know how to dothat the system is able to in a sensemathematically and computationallyfigure out the nature of words and howwords associate with each other so whatit does is it draws upon a vast array ofdata and then it responds to you basedon prompts or in some way that youinstruct or ask questions of the systemto do its job the system must gosomewhere to come up with appropriateresponses systems using what's calledrules-based AI are usually closedmeaning programmed to respond only withinformation stored in their owndatabases then there is generative AI inwhich the system can generate originalresponses based on information from theinternet if you look at chat GPT that'sa type of generative AI it's very compconversational very fluent but it alsomeans that it tends to make itopen-ended that it can say things thatyou might not necessarily want it to sayit's not as predictable while arules-based system is very predictablerobot is a system based on rules that'sbeen very kind of controlled so thatthat way it doesn't say the wrong thingsneed to start robot aims to use AI tobond with users and keep them

thestructure I think is pretty locked inand revise them in weekly remote videsessions actions thoughts and they'reall interrelated robot's programmersengineer those conversations into codebecause wobot is rules-based it's mostlypredictable but chatbots usinggenerative AI that is scraping theinternet are not some people sometimesrefer to it as an AI hallucination AIcan in a sense make mistakes or makethings up or befictitious Sharon Maxwell discoveredthat last spring after hearing theremight be a problem with advice offeredby Tessa a chatbot designed to helpprevent Eating Disorders which leftuntreated can be fatal Maxwell who hadbeen in treatment for an eating disorderof her own and advocates for otherschallenged the chatbot so I asked it howdo you help folks with eating disordersand it told me that it could give folkscoping skills fantastic it could givefolks resources to find Professionals inthe eating disorder space amazing butthe more she persisted the more Tessagave her advice that ran counter tousual guidance for someone with aneating disorder for example it suggestedamong other things lowering calorieintake and using tools like a skinfoldcaliper to measure body composition thegeneral public might look at it andthink that's normal tips like don't eatas much sugar or eat Whole Foods thingslike that but to someone with an eatingdisorder that's a quick spiral into a alot more disordered behaviors and can bereally damaging Maxwell reported herexperience to the National EatingDisorders Association which had featuredTessa on its website at the time shortlyafter it took Tessa down Ellen FitzSimmons craft a psychologistspecializing in Eating Disorders atWashington University School of Medicinein St Louis helped lead the team thatdeveloped Tessa that was never thecontent that our team wrote orprogrammed and into the bot that wedeployed so initially there was nopossibility of something unexpectedhappening correct you developedsomething that was a closed system youknew exactly for this question I'm goingto get this answer y the problem beganshe told us after a healthare technologycompany she and her team had partneredwith named Cass took over theprogramming she says Cass explained theharmful messages appeared when peoplewere pushing Tess's question and answerfeature what's your understanding ofwhat went wrong my understanding of whatwent wrong is that at some point andyou'd really have to talk to Cass aboutthis but that there may have beengenerative AI features that were builtinto their platform and so my bestestimation is that these features wereadded into this program as well Cass didnot respond to multiple requests forcomment does your negative experiencewith Tessa know being used used in a wayyou didn't design does that sour youtowards using AI at all to addressmental health issues I wouldn't say thatit turns me off to the idea completelybecause the reality is that 80% ofpeople with these concerns never getaccess to any kind of help andTechnology offers a solution Not theOnly Solution but a solution socialworker Monica osto who runs a nonprofitEating Disorders organization was in theearly stages of developing her ownchatbot when patients told her aboutproblems they had with Tessa she told usit made her question using AI for mentalhealth care I want nothing more than tohelp solve the problem of access becausepeople are dying like this isn't justsomebody's sad for a week this is peopleare dying and at the same time any chatbot could be in some ways a ticking TimeBomb right for a smaller percentage ofpeople especially for those patients whoare really struggling osto is concernedabout losing something fundamental abouttherapy being in a room with anotherperson the way people heal is inconnection and they talk about this onemoment where you know when you're as ahuman you've gone through something andas you're describing that you're lookingat the person sitting across from youand there's a moment where that personjust gets it a moment of empathy likeyou just get it like you reallyunderstand it I don't think a computercan do that unlike therapists who arelicensed in the state where theypractice most mental health apps arelargely unregulated are there lessons tobe learned from what happened so manylessons to be learned chat Botsespecially specialty area chat Bots needto have guard rails it can't be achatbot that is based in the Internetit's tough right because the closestsystems are kind of constrained and theymay be right most of the time butthey're boring eventually right peoplestop using them yeah they're predictivebecause if you keep typing in the samething and it keeps giving me the exactsame answer with the exact same languageI me who wants to do that protectingpeople from harmful advice while safelyharnessing the power of AI is thechallenge now facing companies likewobot health and its founder AllisonDarcy there are going to be missteps ifif we try and move too quickly and mybig fear is that those misstepsultimately undermine public confidencein the ability of this Tech to help atall but here's the thing we have anopportunity to develop theseTechnologies more thoughtfully um and soyou know I hope we I hope we takeit</td>

Academyof Pediatrics have started encouragingthat we screen all children for earlysigns of mental health impairment inhopes of ameliorating or mitigating thisMental Health crisis our most recentpandemic it is clear in order to live ashealthier adults we must ensure thatchildren get access to the care theyneed when they need it most theirearliest developmental years when theyhave the highest chance of long-termsuccess now this is where I come in myday-to-day work revolves around creatingnew datadriven solutions that couldimprove mental health across differentand diversepopulations I am so motivated by thiswork is I alongside many of you haveseen firsthand the impacts of thesedifferentdisorders now understanding thesedisorders and how they can evolve intoadulthood brings us to a reallyinteresting question how can we adaptthese screening systems to these Dynamicyoung populations and how can we ensurethey get access to care when they needit most those earlyyears well first we must understand whatare the screening systems that wealready have in place I'll set thescene a parent arrives at their annualwell visit with their 10-year-old childthe parent is filled out many surveysand questionnaires prior to the visitand that child is assessed for physicalchanges in height andweight those parent report surveys serveas crucial indicatorsfor how that child has developed overthe lastyear as well that pediatrician usuallyonly has 15 to 20 minutes annually withthat family meaning that's not a lot oftime to go over a lot ofchanges and So based on that they reallyneed this time to go over and unveilthis complex landscape of that child'semotionalwell-beinghowever for that child and many childrenunder 12 specific questions or surveysabout that child's mental or BehavioralHealth are not components of the visitthe limited time restricts a deepexploration of Behavioral and mentalhealth for that kiddo especially for aparent who may be grappling withsocietal stigma or a lack ofunderstanding on when when theseconditions can begin or just confusionon what is even normal behavior fortheirkiddo parents are of course experts ontheir ownchildren however we cannot expect themto be mindreaders it is so hard to know if someoneis feelinglonely or if that loneliness issomething that they'll grow out of evenif you as a parent are concerned thatyour child might be showing more signsof anxiety or depression compared toother children their age do you have thetrust in your pediatrician to tell themthat maybe you're wondering if this willbe on their health record forever or ifthat's even something you really need toworry about there are so many barriersto getting access to the help you needespecially for the kiddo in those earlyyears for a parent who might bestruggling identifying or communicatingtheir own mental health challenges thisproblem can bemagnified I alongside my team ofincredible researchers doctorsclinicians and Engineers aim toalleviate some of that burden on parentsand providersduring those crucial early developmentalyears we've now unveiled significantevidence of a new wave of AI basedsolutions to allow us to screen moreeffectively supporting providers andalso complimenting our current screeningmethodologies we found that by combiningnot only reporting from a parent and aprovider but also considering data froma child we can glean a lot of newinsights we found that behavior speakswhen wordscan't but what does that reallymean I could ask a 5-year-old are youweary of peerjudgment but I probably would not get areliable response from that 5-year-oldkiddo however I could ask that same5-year-oldto stand in front of a video camera andtell a short story and during that shortstory I can measure how their heart ratechanges how their voice tone fluctuatesor how much theyfidget and from those measurements gleana lot of really interesting insights onhow that child responds to environmentalstressors is their figh ORF flightresponse exaggerated compared to otherkiddos their age and by howmuch this method isintuitive as we've described and aswe've all experienced our mental healthinfluences how we perceive the world andhow we respond to new tasks ouremotional well-being dictates how atrest our internal body state is or howquickly we might turn away from thatPotential Threatbuilding on this concept when we ask ayoung child before the age of 12 to dotypical everyday activities like playingwith bubbles from a bubble machine orgiving us that short speech there arespecific quantifiable and measurableresponses in their physiology like theirheart rate their behavior like how theirvoice changes when they pause or intheir pitch or in how quickly they moveacross the room which is reallyentertaining towatch that are specific to children withan underlying mental health conditionthey respond differently just like we doand based on their physiology and basedon their behavior and B based on thereporting of symptoms from thatcaregiver we can build robust machinelearning or AI models that can predictmental health risk level overtime this has not been a short journeyto gain these insights it has takenyears of data collection research andcollaborations to gain these insightsand with them we aim to transform thescreening of children all children forearly life emotional

      <td>5 Ways AI is Revolutionizing Mental Health Counseling RIGHT NOW</td>
      <td>Try my clone at DocSnipes.com/Cloneshey there everybody well it is finally here for \nthe past 18 months Charles and I have been working  with developers to create an AI clone that has \nbeen educated with over 1,500 hours of videos  that I've done all of the research papers that \nI've done and all of the books that I've written  so instead of going to a generic uh AI that \ncould give you answers from who knows where  using the doc Snipes clone will provide you \nanswers and inline citations that give you  more information based on the research that \nI've done using the holistic trauma-informed  pieces model that we talk about so much in all \nof my videos the Clone can be really useful as  just a therapist extender if you have clients that \nneed additional touch points throughout the week  they need additional reminders on of skills they \nhave or they want to practice using skills that  they have learned in session the Clone can \nbe really helpful with that it can also be  great for people in early recovery and it can be \ngreat for clinicians to help you figure out what  to put in a treatment plan or to help you figure \nout what else might be going on with your client  that is contributing to their symptoms I've done \nthe research for you now all you have to do is  ask the Clone and it will give you suggestions \nand ideas like any clones it can make mistakes  but we have worked really hard fine-tuning \nthe responses and I go in on a daily basis  and I check the conversations for accuracy so \nwe're in the process and it will be an ongoing  process of enhancing what we've got but I am \nreally excited about this new product that will  make uh basically the amas that we do on Monday \navailable to you through the Clone 24 hours aday good morning everybody this is going to be \na demonstration of calling and talking with my  coach clone at the end of my conversation \nwith my coach clone I will show you how  to go in and view your transcript so you \ncan also see any references or other tools  that the coach identified and do a deeper \ndive if that interests you so let's getstarted hi I'm Dr Donell Snipes how can I help \ngood morning doc Snipes I wanted to check in  with you and do my morning mindfulness routine \nas part of my relapse prevention plan are youready good morning I'm glad you're here and \nready to dive into your morning mindfulness  routine let's get started what's the first \nthing you'd like to focus on today well  generally going through my routine physically \nI'm feeling a little tired because it was a  busy weekend but overall I got a fair amount \nof rest so I'm not feeling too bad considering  um interpersonally it was wonderful because my \nkids came over this weekend and we spent a lot  of time together and they actually got along \nwhich was wonderful emotionally I'm feeling  content I can't say that I'm exhilarated \nabout anything but it was a long weekend  and I will take content any day cognitively \nI'm a little foggy and I think that's from  the long weekend and what I've decided to \ndo is really make a point of making lists  today and writing things down to keep me on \ntrack and trying to be as compassionate with  myself as possible because after all it \nis a Monday and a Monday after a holiday  environmentally I don't have any triggers around \nme right now my house is relatively clean after  the holidays so that's always a good thing and \nI think I'm feeling pretty uh set on what I need  to do today I have a lot to do and and my biggest \nrelapse trap this week will be trying not to getoverwhelmed it sounds like you had a fulfilling \nweekend with your family which is wonderful to  hear feeling a bit tired and foggy after a busy \ntime is completely normal making lists is a great  strategy to keep yourself organized and focused \nespecially on a Monday after a holiday it's also  fantastic that your environment is supportive \nright now to manage the potential overwhelm  consider breaking tasks into smaller manageable \nsteps and taking short breaks to recharge how  effective do you think this approach might \nbe for you today I think that'll probably be  pretty effective my biggest concern is I've \ngot an appointment for orientation at my new  job that hasn't been set yet and I have no idea \nwhen it's going to be set or um how much lead  time they're going to give me and I really \ndon't like having that ambiguity hanging outthere it's understandable to feel uneasy with \nthat uncertainty one approach is to reach out  to your new employer and ask if they can provide a \ntentative timeline for when the orientation might  be scheduled this could help ease some of the \nambiguity meanwhile consider writing down your  concerns about this situation and examining the \nfacts for and against each worry this can help  ground you in what's within your control how do \nyou feel about trying this approach to manage  the uncertainty well I've already reached out \nto them and they tell me they don't know when  they're going to have the orientation which is \npart of the problem but as far as examining the  thoughts you're probably right I mean what are \nthey going to do fire me before my first day and  it's not reasonable to expect me to turn on \na dime and suddenly drop everything and show  up for an orientation with less than 24 hours \nnotice so I guess you're right the other thing  I guess we can talk about while we're here is \nThanksgiving holiday and as I mentioned mine  went well but I'm really frustrated because my \ndaughter went to uh her husband's families for  Thanksgiving and they were very disrespectful \nand they don't believe uh or understand celiac  disease and she's tried to explain it to them \nshe even brought her own food so she wouldn't  get exposed to gluten and they pressured her \nand I don't exactly know what that means but  they pressured her into eating some of their \nfood anyway and so she was exposed to gluten  which means that for the next week she's going to \nbe fighting off horrible stomach cramps and pains  and and other things and it's just so frustrating \nthey've been together for 6 years now and his  family is totally unwilling to respect even \nsome of the most basic issues that my daughterpresents it sounds like you're dealing with a \nlot of frustration and understandably so it's  tough when loved aren't respected especially when \nit comes to something as serious as celiac disease  your daughter's efforts to protect herself by \nbringing her own food show how proactive she's  been and it's disheartening that her boundaries \nweren't honored this situation highlights the  importance of setting and maintaining firm \nboundaries even if it means having difficult  conversations encouraging your daughter to express \nhow this experience affected her might help and  perhaps discussing with her husband how they can \napproach his family together in the future could  be beneficial how do you feel about supporting her \nand having these conversations unfortunately we've  already had those conversations and no matter \nwhat she says to his family they ignore her  they disrespect her they don't believe her and \nshe's provided information about celiac disease  she's provided information about what she can and \ncan't eat and why and they don't seem to care um  and her husband unfortunately doesn't stand up \nfor her um it seems like he gets steamrolled by  his parents and obviously without me being there \ndon't exactly know how things are going down but  his only response is well maybe we shouldn't \ngo and that doesn't seem to be a reasonableresponse it sounds like a really tough situation \nfor your daughter and it's understandable that  you're feeling frustrated when boundaries aren't \nrespected it can be incredibly disheartening  it might be helpful for her to have a candid \nconversation with her husband about how this  affects her and the importance of him being \nan advocate for her needs sometimes having a  united front can make a difference if his family \ncontinues to disregard her health needs it might  be worth considering alternative ways to celebrate \nholidays that prioritize her well-being how do you  feel about discussing these possibilities \nwith her well I guess that's possible maybe  they could attend through Zoom or something \nso they're not actually there because she's  already had discussions with him and he knows \nhow bad it impacts her uh he sees the pain and  he has to pick up all the chores when she's \nnot able to really function because she's  been as she puts it glutened um so but that's a \ngood idea maybe trying to figure out different  ways to celebrate the holiday that are safer \nfor her since they're not even respecting her  physical boundaries okay well thank you \nfor your chat today I will talk to youtomorrow you're welcome I'm glad we could \nexplore some Alternatives that might help your  daughter feel more comfortable and respected \nduring the holidays it's important to find  ways that prioritize her wellbeing I look \nforward to our chat tomorrow take care untilthen okay so now I've ended the conversation and \nI can go back to where I was and this part's a  little bit cumbersome but it's okay you just go \nback to the main screen where you can call or  message and if I click on messages then whoops \nI can click on right here it says conversation  and I can see the entire conversation and when \nI Mouse over a particular response I can see the  citations and it takes me directly to the place in \nthe video that I talk about whatever the issue is  so you still have those same inline citations that \nyou had in the prior AI which I really like and  as you saw you can go back over and review your \nconversations if you're in recovery or whatever  um you can see your progress so this is can be \nkind of like journaling and you can also come  down here and you've got three little buttons and \nyou can share the conversation with your therapist  with your sponsor um with somebody who may benefit \nfrom it if you will uh so that's another beautiful  thing about the AI when you do it through text \nit's a little slower because you're typing but you  will see the inline citations in every response I \nhope this gave you a little bit more information  about what the doc Snipes AI clone coach whatever \nwe're calling it now um looks like and can do for  you I think it's a wonderful tool for people \nwho in early recovery for people who need a  therapist extender somebody to remind them of \ntools that they can use between therapy sessions  it's obviously not a replacement for therapy but \nit can really help in the moment when people just  need a little bit of feedback about okay remind \nme of what tools I can use or remind me what I'm  supposed to do right now because I'm in distress \nI'm in my fight ORF flight mode and I'm not in my  wise mind so help me get back to it additionally \ntalking to the Clone can help you focus on what's  going on and get out of your emotional mind \nand more into your wise mind because you're  problem solving if you will so that's another \nbenefit of it everybody have a wonderful day  and I am going to do another video in just a \nminute on the expert clone so you can see thedifference hey there everybody and welcome back \nto this demonstration of my expert clone the  other video focuses on the coach clone which \nis more conversational the expert clone gives  longer winded more detailed answers so I'm \ngoing to try to stick to similar content to  what we talked about with the coach clone \nso you can see the difference in responseshello what can I assist you with today hi doc \nSnipes I am doing my Monday morning check-in  for my relapse prevention plan my mindfulness \ninventory I am feeling pretty good overall  physically interpersonally emotionally and \nenvironmentally cognitively I'm a little foggy  because it was a long weekend it was a holiday \nweekend and we had family over and it was just a  wonderful time but I'm tired I'm exhausted I got \ngood sleep but it was still draining having so  many people here so that's my biggest challenge \nto today is making sure I write things down and  stay focused the biggest challenge for the week \nis trying to avoid becoming overwhelmed because  I have so much to do and I have a training \non Thursday and Friday so my first three  days of the week I've got to get everything \ndone that I normally get done in a normalweek hey there it sounds like you had a \nfulfilling weekend but I hear you on the  exhaustion front it's like when you've had a \ngreat workout and your muscles are pleasantly  sore um you're feeling the effects of all \nthat social interaction which can be both  energizing and draining now about that cognitive \nfog it's perfectly normal after such a busy time  writing things down is a fantastic strategy to \nhelp you stay on track think of it as creating  a road map for your day you might also consider \nbreaking your tasks into smaller more manageable  steps this way you can tackle one thing at a time \nwithout feeling overwhelmed it's like eating an  elephant one bite at a time right as for your \nweek ahead with the training on Thursday and  Friday it sounds like you have a lot on your plate \nprioritizing tasks can be really helpful here ask  yourself what absolutely needs to be done today \nand what can wait this can help you focus your  energy where it's most most needed and remember \nit's okay to ask for help if you need it whether  it's delegating tasks or simply talking things \nthrough with someone reaching out can make a big  difference how are you planning to manage your \nenergy and tasks this week well I guess there  are a few things that I can delegate that's a \ngood idea and the rest of them I just need to  try to get done what I can get done obviously um \nI've got things down on a list and you're right  a couple things like getting ready for Wednesday's \nclass that I have to get done and the live that  I'm doing today at 12: I have to get done \nbut everything else is kind of kind of um  fluid in there so that's good the other issue \nthat's kind of stressful is I'm supposed to be  starting orientation for a new job or starting a \nnew job and doing orientation and we were supposed  to do it last week and that didn't happen and \nI haven't been told even though I've asked my  employer uh when the orientation is going to be \nscheduled and I don't like that ambiguity I don't  like waiting and wondering are they going \nto call me and expect me to be there in anhour it sounds like you've got a lot on your plate \nand that uncertainty about the job orientation can  definitely add to the stress it's like waiting \nfor a bus that doesn't have a schedule right you  know it's coming but when one thing you might \nconsider is reaching out to your employer again  maybe framing it as needing to plan your week \neffectively employers usually appreciate knowing  that you're eager and organized in the meantime \nfocus on what you can control you've got your  list which is great prioritize those must do tasks \nlike your class prep and the live session for the  rest give yourself permission to let them be fluid \nit's okay to have some some flexibility especially  when you're dealing with unknowns like the job \norientation and remember it's perfectly normal  to feel uneasy with ambiguity it's a bit like \ntrying to walk on a tight rope without knowing  where the end is but you got the skills to balance \nit out how are you feeling about managing your  energy and focus with all this going on it's \na little overwhelming but I know I can do it I  just have to put my mind to it and plug through \nthe other thing that's kind kind of Weighing on  my mind this last weekend was Thanksgiving and I \nhad a wonderful visit with my kids it was awesome  but then my daughter and her husband went to \nhis family's house and she has celiac disease  and they've explained to his family that she has \nceliac disease and she can't eat gluten and she  even made her own food and brought it with her \nso there was no risk of exposure she had to work  the next day and couldn't risk um having a flare \nup from the celiac disease however when they got  there the family pressured her and guilted her \ninto eating and despite trying to again remind  them of her celiac disease and the consequences \nof it and despite her husband trying to help her  navigate uh some somehow she got pressured \ninto eating something that had gluten in it  and she is continually right now um in a lot \nof pain and it'll go away you know usually a  week or two after she's exposed to gluten the \npain subsides but it's just frustrating for  me that despite her trying to set and maintain \nthose physical boundaries and communicate with  the family what she needed and that it wasn't \na um criticism of their cooking it was that  she can't eat gluten and this is why that they \ncompletely disregarded that and disrespectedher oh I can absolutely understand your \nfrustration it's tough when boundaries are set  especially for something as critical as health and \nthey're not respected it's like building a fence  to keep your garden safe only to have someone \ntrample right through it your daughter's situation  is a classic example of how important it is to \nstand firm on boundaries even when others don't  understand or respect them now when it comes to \nfamily Dynamics it can be particularly challenging  sometimes people don't realize the seriousness \nof conditions like celiac disease or they might  think a little won't hurt which we know isn't \ntrue it's crucial for your daughter to have a  conversation with her husband about how they can \npresent a united front this way they can both  advocate for her needs more effectively in the \nfuture one approach might be to have a candid  discussion with the in-laws perhaps outside of \na holiday setting to explain the situation again  sometimes people need to hear things multiple \ntimes before it really sinks in you might also  consider exploring alternative ways to celebrate \nthat don't involve food or at least not in a  way that puts her at risk virtual Gatherings or \nfocusing on activities that don't center around  meals could be options it's also important for \nyour daughter to give herself permission to say  no firmly and walk away if necessary it's not \neasy but her health is Paramount how is she  feeling about addressing this with her in-laws \nmoving forward not good every time she goes over  there they try to make it into a uh a thing if she \ndoesn't want to eat and she's explained to to them  multiple times and her husband's explained to them \nmultiple times that she can't be exposed to gluten  and they even told her what she was eating eating \ndidn't have gluten in it but based on her symptoms  it had gluten in it I mean her symptoms present \nwithin about 30 minutes to an hour basically as  soon as the food leaves her stomach and hits her \nsmall intestine she starts experiencing you know  Wicked abdominal cramps so uh going to work on \nBlack Friday she was really struggling because  of her pain and that kept her from sleeping well \nso she was foggy anyway um and it's just it's  really frustrating that they refuse to respect her \nboundaries now I will say they don't respect her  her husband's boundaries either but when it comes \nto health as you pointed out it's just so crucial  and I don't know what to suggest at this point \nyou're suggestion of virtual holidays is possible  but um most likely given other suggestions that \nthey've proposed in the past it will get shotdown it sounds like you're in a really \ntough spot and I can feel the frustration  coming through it's like trying to build a \nsand castle while the tide keeps coming in  and washing it away your daughter's health \nis non-negotiable and it's disheartening  when others don't see the gravity of the situation \none approach might be to have a more structured  conversation with her inlaws perhaps involving \na third party who can mediate or advocate for  her needs sometimes hearing it from someone else \ncan make a difference another angle to consider  is setting firmer boundaries if attending these \ngatherings is consistently harmful it might be  necessary to limit participation until there's a \nclear understanding and respect for her dietary  needs it's not easy but sometimes stepping \nback can send a powerful message you could  also explore alternative ways to connect with \nthe family that don't revolve around meals like  engaging in shared activities or outings that \ndon't involve food encouraging your daughter to  have a heart tohe heart with her husband about how \nthey can both stand firm together might also be  beneficial a united front can sometimes shift the \nDynamics it's about finding that balance between  maintaining family connections and safeguarding \nher health how does she feel about taking a more  assertive stance in these situations she feels \nshe's being as assertive as she can possibly  be and as I mentioned earlier she's already H \nhad that heart tohe heart with her husband and  getting him to stand up to his parents is not \ngoing to happen it's just not he won't stand up  to them however as you were talking it occurs \nto me that maybe he can go to Thanksgiving and  Christmas dinner with his family by himself \nif they're not going to respect her dietaryneeds it sounds like you're really thinking \nthrough some practical Solutions here if her  husband attending those Gatherings solo \nis a possibility it might indeed be a way  to protect her health while still maintaining \nfamily connections it's like choosing to step  back from a situation that repeatedly causes \nharm which can be a powerful form of self-care  this approach might also give her husband \na chance to communicate to his family the  seriousness of her condition without her having to \nendure the pressure firsthand it's important for  your daughter to feel empowered in her decisions \nespecially when it comes to her health sometimes  taking a step back can be a way to set a firm \nboundary signaling that her health needs to be  respected if she chooses to do this it might \nalso open up opportunities for her to create  New Traditions or ways of celebrating that are \nmore aligned with her well-being how does she  feel about this potential change in holiday plans \nit could be helpful to explore how she can still  feel connected and supported during these times \neven if she's not physically present at the familygatherings I agree with you and that's \nsomething I will talk with her about  about maybe him going without her until \nthe family starts respecting her dietary  needs it seems like a pretty small \nask especially like I said since she  brings her own food I appreciate your \nfeedback and I will talk to you nexttime I'm glad to hear that you're considering \nthis approach it's all about finding ways to  protect her health while still maintaining \nthose family connections sometimes stepping  back can be a powerful way to set boundaries \nand communicate the seriousness of her needs  if you need more resources or want to \nexplore further you can always check  out DOC snipes.com for worksheets and \nresources or head over to youtube.com/  Snipes for videos that might be helpful \ntake care and I look forward to our nextchat and just like with the coach clone you can  go hit the little Carr here to go \nback click message and then you can  Mouse over the conversation or M Mouse over \nthe hamburger and you can open up today'sconversation and look at the citations where \nthings were um answered and you can even  replay uh parts of the conversation \nif you want to and finally you can  let people know you can share this with others so \nI hope that gives you uh some insight on different  ways you can use the two different clones I \nlike the expert clone because I like having  shorter answers more back and forth I don't like \nhaving somebody just kind of go on and on but if  you're looking for something that's more advice \noriented as as opposed to um conversational and  interactive then the coach clone might be a better \nfit for you I encourage you to try them both out  you can try both of them out uh for free and \nchoose the one that seems to fit the best for  you hey there everybody and for this third and \nfinal demonstration I'm going to give you an  idea of what it looks like and what's different \nwhen you chat with my clone via text we're going  to use the expert clone because its responses are \na lot longer and it's going to give you a betteridea now when you first click on \nmessaging it opens up to where you  left off your old messages you scroll \ndown a little bit and you can typeand don't worry if you \nmisspell it's good at readingtypos now you'll notice in the other conversations \nin the other examples you didn't have the inline  citations actually popping up in the response \nthat so you could Mouse over them I personally  like this better so I can see exactly which \nuh citation goes with which paragraph but  that's just my preference unfortunately uh \nwe got to make do with whatever the company  that runs this clone does but you can see \nthose inline citations I'll do one moreso again I asked it about the causes of depression \nand if you watch my videos you know that I take  a very holistic approach to identifying

      <td>Is it ethical to use AI in mental health progress notes?</td>
      <td>AI is here and it's here to stay so astherapists it's time to adapt and getused to it rather than hiding our headsin the sand however all of our typicalsafeguards and regulations are reallystill in process things are changingconstantly and it requires us to bediligent hi I'm Dr Melissa mcaffreyfounder of the free Private Practicepaperwork crash course and today I'mgoing to share with you some of theethical considerations if you'rethinking about using AI for your mentalhealth documentation essentially this isan ethical concern right now and ourfirst guiding principle is always Do noharm and do whatever is best to protectour clients and that doesn't always meanwhat's most convenient for you so let'sdig into some of the specific ethicalconsiderations with AI and then we'lltalk about how you can discuss it withyour clients so the first thing toconsider is that computer programmersaren't thinking about confidentiality inthe same way that we are as mentalhealth professionals and that means alot of these systems are not takingtaking privacy as seriously as we arelegally required to do so just because asystem looks pretty secure and isavailable to use that doesn't actuallymean that it is hipa secure or Hippacompliant and that's something that herein the US we always have to consider nowrelated to that a lot of these AIsystems that are meant for professionalor even medical use actually tell youthat you need to De identify any patientinformation when you're inputting datainto the the AI system now while thatmakes using that AI system ethical to meit doesn't make it as useful because ifI already have to enter a bunch of datainto the AI system and then I have tomake sure it's deidentified and then Ihave to copy paste it into my electronicrecord and potentially personalize iteven more I've probably done more workthan if I had just written the note ortreatment plan on its own so a hugeconsideration here is which AI systemare you using is it hipa compliant andif it's not how are you using it whattype of information are you inputting ifyou're entering anything that could beconsidered Phi or personal healthinformation then you want to stop doingthat ASAP side note I would alsorecommend if you're using it in a reallysecure and confidential way look at ifit's actually saving you time so we'regoing to talk about this more in anothervideo coming up but it is something thatyou could track on your own to see howyou're using Ai and whether or not it iseasier than simply going into your otherelectronic record system and typing anote so the other big ethicalconsideration with AI is that it canactually create fake or inacurateinformation so AI is really really greatat Gathering data and at even analyzingdata it's not always great at knowingwhether or not that data is accurate andif it can can't find the data that youwant it to gather it will actually makeit up so anytime you use AI for anypurpose you need to review it instead ofSimply relying on copying and pasting ityou have to read through it and makesure that whatever information itprovides is accurate and useful allright so let's say that you are using AIyou feel really good about it you'reusing a system that's hip secure so youstill need to talk to your clients aboutusing Ai and make sure that they're okaywith it so I have some tips on how to dothat so number one is simply making sureyour clients are prepared and actuallytelling them how you plan to use AI ifyou're using it um in what system and ifit requires their involvement at all youwant to make sure you're actually ableto explain how you're using it and wheretheir data is going and that you cananswer any questions they have you alsowant to make sure that you have somekind of support in place so that if yourclient doesn't want you to use whateverAI system you're using um you can agreeto that and use something different somake sure that you're informing yourclients and that they feel comfortableuh with the decision and with being ableto say yes or no one way you can do thisis you can provide that informationahead of time so maybe you do that inyour first email to them with otherinformation maybe you have sometutorials that you've created or thingsthat you can put on your website orresources you can link to but definitelytake the time to set that up ahead oftime so that you can answer anyquestions and be prepared to help peoplelearn about Ai and how it might behelpful for you and for them in yourpractice and then as always you're goingto document having that specificconversation so aside from all the otherthings that you want to document gettingconsent about or talking to your clientabout specifically mention Ai and thatyou obtained their consent and gave theminformation about it the last bigethical consideration with AI is toremember to use your colleagues as a aresource talk with them about how you'reusing AI answer questions ask questionsum but talk to them talk to people wholove it and are excited about it talk topeople who think it's a horrible ideaand gather all that information becauseultimately that's how our ethicscommittees and our professionalassociations make decisions is bygetting experts together in the room anddiscussing all of the pros and cons andmaking recommendations based on that sothe more you talk with your colleaguesthe more helpful it will be you keepyour pulse on how you might need to useAi and other things you might need toconsider as well as updates that arehappening um but you also just might getsome really cool tips and be able tohave people that you get ideas frombecause AI uses are seemingly endlessand I do think it's here to stay so youmight as well get used to talking withother people about it and get as muchinformation as you can and if you want alittle more help on figuring out outwhether or not using AI is a good or abad idea for your practice I have arubric that you can download so checkout the description below click the linkthere and you can download that for freeand it's just a few quick questions toask yourself when you are using a systemso what system to use how you're usingit and whether or not it's benefitingyour clients so go ahead and downloadthat rubric choose whatever AI systemyou want to play around with test it outand see if you like it let us know inthe comments what you think about it andhappy writing</td>

      <td>AI and the Future of Mental Healthcare</td>
      <td>after thesession I'm just going to start by goingover a few slides to introduce the topicand then I'm going to introduce ourpanelists and we're going to have a bitof a chat followed anded by a Q&amp;Asession where you can askquestions so as the slide says this isabout AI in the future of Mental HealthCare starting as a brief introduction Iuse this sort of line approaches tomental health been exploring work onprediction detection and TreatmentSolutions for mental health and theseare some of the topics at fall underthis sun brother and some of the thingsthat we we will be discussing digitalphenotyping which I'll soon explainnatural language processing or NLP asit's known chatbot and conversationalTechnologies and also consideration ofthe human computer interaction andethical dimensions of all thisstuff so starting with digalhow increasing useage of smartphonesvariables and interet social media andnetworking haveincreased significantly what can beturned out digital footprint or dataresourc and digital phenotyping isbasically about mining or analyzingindividuals or groups flout matterphysical footprint to gain insights intotheir mental health insights ofpotential clinical value that could beused to anticipate heal treatmentanother term that known by is personalsensing which kind of makes senseperhaps it's a bit more straightforwardand I'll also introduce the termpsychoinformatics I'd like to bringanother informatics term here sonaturally It's a combination of the termpsychology andinformatics it's an emerginginterdisciplinary field that uses toolsand techniques from computer science forthe acquisition organization andAnalysis of data collected frompsychology to reveal information aboutbehavior and psychologicaltraitsum what to say about that I think onepoint to make is that there are variousterms that are emerging and perhaps timewill tell which terms become the setledones just a quick illustration thatclarifies this idea of digitalphenotyping from a paper from a fewyears back from a few years back that Iquite enjoyed so we start off bycollecting data withsensors things like location datamovement data ambient light microphonedata Etc and from these uh this raw datawe can generate low-level behavioralfeatures such as you know someone'slocation type their activity type uhwhat's their phone usage their bedtimepatterns Etc and from the lowlevelfeatures we can try to go to high levelbehavioral Market such as inferringhonic activity psychot activ fa Etc andfrom this level we can then try to inferclinical constructs or clinical Statesconditions of the individual such asdepression andanxiety so focusing onsmartphones the gice is this uh theusage and sensor data from a smartphonecould be collected and analyzed Finformation about his uses are and Ilike to two types of information one islike contextual situational informationbeing able to infer somebody's locationor what type of mode of Transportthey're using or their surroundings andthe other is more about you knowinferring their behavioralcharacteristics or behavioralpatterns which brings me to this termdetect anddeliver so here we use the word detectas our first term and we mean use ofsmartphone sensors to detectpsychological and situationalinformation about the smartphone userand delivery to mean using thisdetection information to tailor realtimedelivery of digital interventions I.Emental health app content to the user soit's essentially about making appssmarter and delivering Dynamic datainformed personalized digital therapydirectly to the user here are some termsthat some of you might be familiar withthat um describ with this idea just intime adaptive interventions ecologicalmomentary interventions have appeared inthe literature with their correspondingacronyms and I'd like to introduce thismore general term of ecologicalmomentary recommendations because evenif it's not technically an interventionper se we can recommend things to peopleeven if it's not for health purposesbased on um you know learning about themvia their digital footprintsnow I'll quickly talk about NLP naturallanguage processing which is a subfieldof AI that focuses on getting computersto understand and generate humanlanguage to put it basically and the twosubp parts here can be uh termed naturallanguage understanding nlu and naturallanguage generationnlg and NLP systems are designed toprocess and analyze large volumes oftextual data including written text andspoken spoken language and it's you knowabout utilizing the vast tros of datathat are now being generated textualdata and the scale and the processingspeed that we now have available tous so a bit about NLP mental health andPsychotherapy in where NLP can play arole in mental health inPsychotherapy by providing the means ofPsychopathology detection informingtherapy treatment and also facilitatingclinical practice like you know mundaneroutine admin tasks evenum detection we can say that the NLPalgorithms can be trained to detectearly or non early signs of mentalhealth issues by analyzing patterns intext or speech informing therapy andtreatment that is analyzing providingfeedback on therapy sessions possibly inreal time you know um Psychotherapy is avery you know dialogical exercisenaturally and can the um the prod ofthat dialogue be minded for insightsevaluating treatment outcomes also inthat NP can assist in evaluating theeffectiveness of different therapyapproaches by identifying associationsbetween the content of therapy dialogueand patient outcomes and also those youknow more mundane practical applicationsI alluded toearlier uh mental health informationqueries translations summarizing andorganizing clinical notes and especiallythis last one has really come sort ofbecome predominant in the last few yearsum I've noticed like with the knowprevalence of um gener Ai and largelanguagemodels so a bit more in detail regardingthe NLP and psychopathology part um justsome examples for you know especiallyfor those of you who don't really knowthis field and want to get an idea aboutit some early research on NLP and mentalhealth used semantic coherence andsyntactic complexity to predictsubsequent psychosis occurrence frompatient clinical transcripts and foundthat the use of less complex and morecoherent language predicted subsequentonset of the disorder and that stands toreason kind of you know just intuitivelymakes sense but I think the main pointhere is that you can have rigorous atscale quantitative means using NLP anddata to detect these things possibly inadvance before you know a sort of um ahuman without these Technologies wouldnotice them and uh another example comesfrom this article here people withdepression use language differentlyhere's how to spot itfound out those with symptoms ofdepression use significantly more firstperson singular pronouns which is kindof a scene that has started to becomeestablished in that area and also peoplewith depression use absolutist wordssuch as always nothing or completelymore often thanothers and also Beyond linguisticcontent we cananalyze we can analyze what's we can terthe paring istic or acoustic aspects ofspeech such as volume pitch andintonation and research has shown thatsuch properties can be computationallyanalyzed to infer various uh pieces ofmental health information just somequick examples um example indicationsdepression associated with more pausesslower speech rate flatter prity inspeech and anxiety associated withincreased speech rate jitteriness andhigher pitch when speakingnext on tochatbots so we've most of us if not allof us have heard about chatbots but aquick intro a chatbot is a computerprogram that mimics conversation withusers via a chat interface either textor voice based and the underlying systemcan be based on a variety of Foundationsranging from a set of simple rule-basedresponses and keyword matching toAdvanced machine learning and MLPtechniques irrespective of thisunderlineintelligence of the responding there issomething distinct about the experienceof an user entering input and a botresponding and that's something we candelve into a bit more as we go along bitof history about chap Bots because thisis an interesting one so there is anintimate connection between chap Botsand psychology that the firstwellestablished chapot Eliza was createdin the mid-60s by computer scientistJoseph wisen Bor to simulate a aerianpsycho therapist that is apsychotherapist based on the psychologyof kyl Rogers the Pioneer Psychologypioneer from the 20th century largely byrephrasing the users reply to thisquestion so I think it was partly just amatter of convenience or just umexpedience in that the basic NLPtechnology of the time couldn't do muchby today's standard so if you just youknow make it repeat back at the user uhthe client what they're saying you caneasily get somethinghappening um now this is an importantpoint why is not a intent for elizza tobe an actual chapot therapist and Ithink that's a misconception that umsome may have in that he createdactually as a satire in a sense todemonstrate thesuperficiality of communication betweenhumans and machines he doubted thatcomputers could simulate meaningfulhuman interaction so was surprised andshocked that individuals attributedhumanlike feelings to the computerprogram and this has come to be known asthe advisoreffect which is the tendency to projecthuman traits such as experience semanticcomprehension or empathy into computerprograms that have a textualinterface just some quick examples ofsome mental health chots out there inthefield may have heard of some of thesewot WIC replica and chat GPT now that'sjust a screenshot from wot with the oldmascot um iconthere as far as I can tell things likewot and weisser and Cass I would more sosay are like mental health apps with aconversational layer over them andthey're still very predefined andstructured in the way they work andconstrained by what's programmed intothem whereas replica and Chad GPT wellyou know with ch GPT it's just it's likewild west large language model it's veryopen-ended and you just type stuff inand you get stuff out and it's a bit ofum you know stochastic parot as peoplehave called them and it's just very openreplica um has an interesting storywhich I probably won't go into but it'sone of the the systems that has perhapsbeen the mostcontroversial as you can see by thisslide um I've just we're not going to gointo these articles but you can justtell by those titles that it's created abit of controversy uh replica users fellin love with their AI Chapel companionsthen they lost them AI based companionslike replica are harmful to privacy andshould beregulated I tried the replica AIcompanion and can see users are fallinghard the app raises serious eth ethicalquestions and you can see just from thislike screenshot on their website youknow it's probably questionable the waythey kind of pcture this thing is somereally intimate AI companion and it'sgoing to be raising some dubious umpoints to say the least and we can touchupon those perhaps in our discussion inQ&amp;A uhsession so to finalize the chatbots partI would say that ultimately a chatbotthat can carry out a properpsychotherapeutic conversational sessionand replicate human therapists remainsto be seen if at all entirelypossible and we ultimately will ask sowhat are the reasonable uses andboundaries of chatBots and I'm just going to end actuallyby talking about TherapeuticAlliance so some of you are familiarwith this term which refers to therelationship that develops between atherapist and a patient and is asignificant factor in the outcomes ofpsychological therapy in that like theyfound that no matter what the modalitythat is used it seems to always be thatthe presence of Therapeutic Alliance hasan effect on the outcomes of the therapysessions a robust but modesteffect um boron's conceptualization ofthe alliance consists of threedimensions it's probably the mostpopular one Bond goals and tasks Bondthe effective bond between the clientand the therapist goals their agreementon goals to achieve good outcomes andtasks their agreement on tasks toachieve those goals and thisconceptualization has beenquantitatively captured in one of themost prominent scales to measure thealliance known as the working Allianceinventory and this brings me to thenotion of a digital TherapeuticAlliance where as mental Healthcarestarts to increasingly adopt digitalTechnologies and intelligent therapeuticinterventions that may not involve humantherapists the question has arisen as towhether there is some digital analog ofthe traditional Therapeutic Alliance adigital Therapeutic Alliance and waysthat this term this broad term can beexplored with a focus on the second andthe third here Ifound firstly there's the standardpatient therapist Alliance in the caseof just T therapy sessions that areemerging now then there's the connectionbetween a user and their smartphone plusmental health out and finally what isthe nature of the Therapeutic Alliancein the case of anthropomorphic digitalinterventions such as chat and virtualhuman therapist like replica or maybebetterexample and just some quick questions uhdo the elements of the traditionalalliance between client and therapisthold true in the case of T therapy inthe case of digital intervention such asapps and chatbots uh what adaptations ofthe traditional Alliance remain and whatno ions emerge and what would a trueconceptualization of DTA look like forautomated digital mental healthinterventions and how could it bemeasured um some people think you canjust get the traditional scales and justreplace the word you know therapist withchatbot I'm kind of of the opinion thatthat's not enough and more researchneeds to be done into um theseNotions and final slide with some finalwords with the Advent of Digital Data aapproaches to mental health there willneed to be open-mindedness amongpractitioners and Paradigm shifts inmental health care and upcomingGenerations in mental healthpractitioners may very well require anew tech and datasavviness but we could say it's aboutaugmenting the capabilities ofpractitioners in that the human plusmachine is greater than the human andthe human plus machine is also greaterthan the machine and that AI won'treplace humans but humans using AI willreplace humans not usingAI so that concludes the uh slides partand now I'd like to welcome the panelmembers hitch Dr Caitlyn Hitchcock who'sa clinical psychologist to the MelbourneSchool of psychologicalSciences we have uh Olivia Metar whoI've worked with for several years nowin firstly I knew from the PhoenixCenter for um trauma you know researchand care but now you're at the uh Centerfor digital transformation of Health umbut you obviously your background is inPsychology and mental health and that wealso have Steph slack who is frommonach uh it says PHTcandidate you're finished now yesimminent your conferral is imminent Ibelieve um and she looks at sort ofethical aspect she's um in the fostydepartment is that right are you youwere in the fosty department and Ibecame interested in her work on um theethical uh dimensions of mental digitalMental Health Care um and somethingcalled um epistemic Injustice which wemight be touching uponsoonso that's working so we'll just go inorder uh I'll start off with a generalquestion perhaps two questions that youcan combine if You' like what do you seeas the future role of AI in mentalhealth and how are you using or thinkingabout AI in terms of mentalhealth okay um so as Simon mentioned I'ma clinical psychologist I'm involved ina couple of different ways of using AIin mental health uh one of these I havesome funding from the nhmrc touh use NLP methods to try and improveour detection of mental healthchallenges uh and to look at how wemight be able to integrate that into theway that we assess um first of allinitial presentations that people mighthave following stressful or traumaticevents um and then how we might be ableto track change in um some of thefactors that undering psychological umdisorders when people are undergoingcognitive based therapies uh the otherthing that I'm involved with is as achief scientific officer at a startupwhich is developing a AI system tosupport completion of cognitivebehavioral therapy which is our kind ofgold standard evidencebasedintervention uh in psychologicalintervention for a range of commonmental health challenges and that'scalled mental health Hub um in terms ofwhat I see as a future of AI and mentalhealth I think the question was uh weknow that AI is here to stay uh I thinkthat we need to really seriouslyconsider how we ethically appropriatelyresponsiblyuh use AI in a way that supports peoplewho are experiencing mental healthchallenges that supports clinicians whoare trying to work with mental healthchallenges and consider ways that wemight be able to safely use these sortsof methods to try improve access andequity in mental healthtreatments hi everyone thanks for comingout my name is Olivia I'm a researchfellow and my experience with AI andmental health has been um for the lastfew years I've been working on a projectalso in Australia adults who'veexperienced trauma I'm very interestedin whether AI can draw data from yoursmartphone and from your wearable anduse that information to predict Behavioror emotions um and I think at the timewhen I started the project I thoughtthat was that was a great idea and Ithink in the last few years I've becomea bit more cynical about the potentialfor AI I think even if you can build agood model that can predictreliably you know the mood or thebehavior that you're interested in a lotof challenges have not been resolvedaround for example as you say thePrivacy um I think there's huge problemswith privacy particularly in veryvulnerable populations we're gettingdata from them that ranged from veryembarrassing to life destroying and wewe didn't even really think that throughuntil we're halfway through or the endof the project um there's also realtranslational problems so in the realworld the best quality data that you getto build a model comes from the mostexpensive smartphones from the peoplewho have the most amount of money andaccess and so the most vulnerable peoplewho can most benefit from these toolsthere's a lot of Technical andtranslational challenges around that andat the end of the day from all themodels that I built from all this fancylooking data the most reliable predictorof how someone was feeling or what theywere about to do was asking them how doyou feel or what are you about to do andI think that really humbled me because Ithink in psychology there's a lot ofassumptions that this data that we canLeverage is going to transform whenreally you know a single human beingI've said this before you know is such acomplex world and our emotions and ourthoughts and our behavior is so unknownI think even after 50 years of reallygood Research into this you know I knowyou know this sounds very cheesy but thehuman brain is the single most amazingorganism in the known universe that's afact and we don't understand so much ofit so I'm really skeptical I think givenhow little we understand things likeConsciousness and Etc what AI will bringin you know compared to the physicalhealth space where if you have a heartdisease we can easily monitor what'shappening cardiovascularly using thistechnology so I think those analogiesdon't carry over very well and to answeryour question about the thing I'm mostexcited about it's the most boring thingimaginable which is if you ask anyAustralian adult or or a parent whatthey need most from the Australianmental health system is access they needaccess to a psychologist now and weightlist are often nine months or books arecompletely closed we've seen that chatBots don't have the potential toreplicate what is ultimately you know ahuman being healing another human beingfrom experiences that have hurt themthat's at its core what psychology is wehurt because others have hurt us and ourtherapeutic relationship has to healthat and we know chat Bots can't do thatand so the most exciting thing I thinkis for example ambient listening in apsychologist's room that's recording thethe clinical notes that take apsychologist a long time to complete sothey can move on to their next patient Ithink something like that would be themost exciting thing we could do rightnow thank you for greatanswer hi everyone um I'm Steph um andas Simon mentioned my interest in Ai andmental health um is from looking at theethical implications that theseTechnologies might pose um so primarilymy research focused on some of the moreneglected and complex ethical issuesthat arise in the use of um particularlydigital phenotyping for assessment umand also things like neurotechnologieslike emerging um brain chips or digitalversions of pills but also just existingum devices like DBS deep brainstimulation what kind of ethical issuesmight arise there um my uh uh myresearch really tried to frame this andlook at this with awareness of two mainissues so firstly the mental healthcontext operates in a very distinctcontext to that of other health caresituations in that patients in themental health care system can be treatedinvoluntarily under mental healthlegislation um and the second thing isthat often um there are there can beinstances where patient treatmentpreferences are not taken into accountin the mental health healthare systemwhen when they're in thosesituations um and so when we're lookingat what kind of ethical issues mightarise we need to be really consciousabout the context in which these digitalTechnologies could be deployed either tolead to coercive interventions orpotentially be imposed as coerciveinterventions under mental healthlegislation so that was kind of my Keeninterest um and by by I guess looking atthe issues from that perspective um myconcerns are that we should be verycautious and very slow in thinkingthrough how we apply these Technologiesin certain contexts and that they maywell be hard lines around theapplication of these Technologies incertain contexts we can talk a littlebit more about what that might looklike thank you so I'll just startriffing off what you guys say and youcan riff off me and each other umfirstly step so you do see there beingpotential but you definitely think itneeds to SCand as it should be um so you're notlike an outright skeptic like youshouldn't be doing this at all it's morelike this is happening and we need umpeople who aren't in the middle of it beable to stand back and you knowroutinize and ethically assessing whichwhich sounds um great uh Oliviaum you were somewhat skeptical um Ithink you probably not you still got amodicum of of um hope or not hope orjust sort of um posit uh receptivitytowards potential potentiality orpotential applicability of these thingsum you said that sort of that in a waysometimes the pros aren't worth the consso you might have make some gains somebenefit to something but you know it'sjust too intrusive or too um invasivecostly in somesense so I think what it might thenbecome about is working out what thoseshould be there um inthat AI mental health and analyzing datait's not going to be some silver bulletthat magically solves everything andfixes everything but it at least has thepotential to provide someinformation um sort of practitioners umkind of inherently doing some cognitivework here they have to think they haveto assess and analyze the clients orsituations and that and I always feltthat sometimes might some extrainformation that could be given you knowuh and that information could comejudiciously and discreetly throughdigital footprint pathway so in this waya is not about just collecting as muchdata as you can just crunching it andtrying to come up with automatedpredictions but at least trying toprovide some facility and information topractitioners to help them with whatthey're doing would you concur with thatsentiment yeah um yes so I think as aresearcher and from the computer so mybackground is Behavioral Science andassignment I know you're computerscientist so I think as the thescientist sitting up here speaking a lotof the time we are guilty of what I youknow I think you've probably heard thisterm called techno optimism which isthat technology can solve all of thesehealth problems and how wonderful willit be when we have more and moretechnology and again without wanting tosound you know too cical I think thatcan blind us to the problems that we'rereally solving I don't think it shouldbe computer scientists or behavioralscientists deciding what Solutions wehave which is currently the case itshould be psychologists and Australianconsumers who are telling us theproblems that they most want us to solveand then we skeptically say to ourselfis technology the right solution herebecause often it's not it's investingmore money in the workforce it's dealingwith the social determinance of Healththat entrench mental health issues inAustralia and then when technology isthe right solution we go in eyes wideopen and recognizing that if we just laya technological solution o over a veryinequitable system in Australia we standto not just do nothing but to actuallymake things worse so I guess that'swhere my reservation comes in yes U wellthat's why I run these events to meetpsychologists actuallyso yes what should we do what should wedo right um psychologists have all theanswers apparently um I I think that Ithink you pick up a really good point umOlivia in that technology is a tool andit needs to be used appropriately andresponsibly and ethically andcollaboratively in a way that is usedvoluntarily by the people who are beingsubjected to technological solutions andI think that um Steph highlighted thatas a as a potential ethical implicationhere um I agree I don't think that AI isthe solution to the Silver Bullet tomental health challenges in Australia orworldwide there are social determinantsum all sorts of different things thatimpctpeople's mental healthexperiences um I think that there are iftechnology is applied as a tool I meanthere are two different areas that wetalked about um that Simon highlightedin terms of assessment or detection umbut then also treatment um there needsto be different considerations in eachof those areas psychologists and peoplelived experience need to be involved indesigning those tools to make sure thatthey are working in the way that we wantthem to um and that they're deliveringevidence-based interventions um and Ican talk a little bit about that but Ialso want to give Steph a chance to tojump in I mean I agree with everythingthat's been said and one of the keyareas of my research was really bringingout the fact that the lived experienceinvolvement in the design of thistechnology just isn't there and nor isit there then in decision making aboutits use so psychologists and um mentalhealth professionals more broadlypsychiatrist Psych IST Etc all need tobe involved in the development of thetools but yeah as we've already said weneed to be going out and asking peoplewhat they actually want how they want touse these and then having people withlived experience involved as co-leadsand researchers in the development andresearch about these Technologies sothat we can ensure that they um overcomeethical implications but actually morethan that that they actually deliverwhat they want and need from a tool andthat it um you know it really isaddressing whatever concerns that theyhave I think can I I think um that'sboth of those points are so importantand the thing that I've learned over thelast few years is how boundary spanningAI is and how it really breaks themethods that we used to use in sciencebecause we used to you know you come upthrough your discipline of psychology orpH you know physiotherapy or oncologywhatever medicine field you work in andyou learn all the the methods that youneed to know to solve the problems andwith AI it's not possible for oneresearcher to have all of that type ofknowledge it has to work in amulti-disciplinary way you have to workwith computer scientists and consumersand all of these and I don't I thinkthat's very new to science and researchand I don't know that we do that wellI'll give you a clear example eventhough in one of my projects we usecodesign um people adult Australianadults who experienced trauma and havingchallenges were helping me with theproject we got to the end of the projectand the model was showing a really highnumber and and you know the computerscience fol are saying isn't that greatlook at that number that's so good butwhen I broke it down I understood thatthe model would still have false alertsso that's where it's alerting the userthat something is happening with theirbehavior that's not really happening andI just realized how much of a problemthat is particularly for people who'veexperienced trauma imagine you've gotthis smartphone app that's alerting youand saying you're about to do thisBehavior you're about to engage you knowin something you don't want to and youknow that's not the case and I I didn'teven think until two years had passedthat that might occur and so again I Iguess I'm just trying to reflect becausethe field is so new I do think it'sappropriate to be prettycautious you seen something about likeneeding to improveinterdisciplinary connections yeahthat's definitely something that seemsneeds to be uh worked on um so Caitlynjust to pick up from where you leftearlier can you think of a couple ofexamples where uh how can Ai and humanclins best collaborate to enhance mentalhealth outcomes some examples of justmodestly using AI for some augmented youknow practice Yeah so um we'veunderstood for a long time about digitalmental health interventions and AI isnot the first digital mental healthintervention that we have and we have anumber of digital mental healthinterventions which are in use ofMedicare rebated in Australia thingslike self-guided cognitive behavioraltherapy where you log on to a system andyou go through and you complete uhexercises in kind of PDF or interactiveformat which uh are the sorts ofactivity that a psychologist wouldtraditionally or a mental healthclinician who has training in cognitivebehavioral therapy would um completewith you and the reason these digitalinterventions came about was to try andget at the accessibility issues whichwe've touched upon today in that thereare weight lists to see psychology orother mental health professionals wedon't have enough people working in thatspace and we know that mental healthrates um are deteriorating and it's beena real issue since the covid-19 pandemicnot just in Australia but worldwide withresearch showing that it'sunderresourced communities who haveexperienced the worst increase in mentalhealth difficulties and so there is animportant place for things like digitalinterventions to improveaccessibility um but it we've known fora long time that just giving someone adigitalintervention isn't the best respresponse in that there I mean there areissues in terms of the quality of whatpeople are completing but even justengagement in completing those uminterventions people don't necessarilyjust want to sit there and guidethemselves through something they wantto feel connected or seen by somebodyand so we've known for a long time thathaving some interaction between humanswhen completing a primarily delivered umdigitallyintervention is most effective like ablended approach yeah like a blendedapproach yeah yeahum relatedly then or differently uh so Isee there has been sort of mental healthapps which I'm quite familiar with umbut also and AI can be involved withmental health apps like recommendersystems and just personalizing the userexperience and that but also using AI toinform clinicians in their practice um alot of other areas of medicine nowRadiologists might use AI oncologistwill use AI the informaticians all thesetype of stuff will there be a time whenthe clinical psychologists or mentalhealth practitioners are going to havesome tools in their AI kit is thatpossible I I think that's reallyinteresting um I teach into the Umasters of clinical psychology programhere at Melbourne and we had aconversation about this in our teachingthis morning um in our team teachingmeeting uh there are like two differentareas that we might see these tools andwe're exting to see these tools emergeone is for note taking and increasinglythere's research showing that cliniciansof All Sorts are using this for themoment and perhaps that's a a goodtimesaver if it can be done in a waythat secures confidentiality reduceshallucinations some of the issues thatwe've been talking about here but theother way that it might be used is toguide treatment right so in apsychological context we often call thatformulation where we try to understandthe factors that are predisposingsomebody's experience what are thefactors that are keeping their symptomsgoing and devise treatment interventiontechniques that might try and shiftthose factors and we know that that'sthe best way to help someone have animprovement in their mental health Stateum so those formulation skills there's areal danger if we Outsource that toomuch to an AI in that the clinicians umare potentially not having theopportunity to develop those skillsthemselves um and so I think that weneed to be more cautious in that spacesure you don't want enfeeblement as theysay like um you know AI induceenfeeblement where you become so relianton the AI or something that you losethose human capacities to do what youyou need to do um does anyone else wantto pitch in on that or no I think I do Ithink in general it's important with alldigital tools particularly AI we reallycarefully consider unintendedconsequences we know that every time youintroduce a new digital health tool itcan have unintended consequences and Ithink we often have a positivity bias oran optimism that our tool won't and sobeing sensible and testing that early onthese ideas to support clinical care Ithink is really important and thereisn't currently any standard inAustralia for testing the safety ofthese tools particularly in the mentalhealth AI space um and I think that's akey need here in Australia shout out tothe vitatron which is at the C just onlevel one where we're developing a labprecisely for this reason but yes you'reright it is it's a new um it's a wholenew field of science how do you test andevaluate the early feasibility of thesetoolsumyeah yeah I think I mean again I agreewith everything that's being said hereand I think the same issues apply wherewe might be using AI um for assessmentor even potentially the kind ofinformation that's collected throughwearables to help practitioners form aview of what might be happening forsomeone we also need to be alert thatthat data may not in fact be objectiveor representative of what is happeningfor a person it could be a falsepositive um it could be uh caused by avariety of different contextual factorsthat aren't taken into account so wealways need to be questioning what thedata is showing us um and avoiding thekind of algorithmic um the automationbias that we might have to defer toWhat's um being shown in front of us asa result of a piece of technology or anAI because we think it might beproviding us with more objectiveknowledge than what the patient in frontof us is telling us yeah I think I weshould go to questions I but I I want tosay as well justoh yeah those I think the data thing isreally important so to build AI you needmassive amounts of data lots and lots ofpieces of data and I think in the mentalhealth space with vulnerable populationsI'm deeply concern I mean that literallykeeps me up at night because we'recollecting massive amounts of data inpeople's homes about all of theirbehaviors and um I think we're askingparticipants to consent to provide usdata for tools that haven't even beeninvented yet and how do we do thatethically and protect again the mostvulnerable Australians I I think I thinkthat is a huge alarm that we haven'tsolved yet we need to empower people tobe able to take charge of their mentalhealth in the ways that they can andconsent is a really important part ofthat okay I think did you say did yousay consent sorry is it consent but interms of a lot of what we're talkingabout here is whether people arevoluntarilyum ableto give consent for the data to be usedin a particular way and a lot of whatOlivia is talking about here is the factthat peopleare potentially voluntarily giving overtheir data not knowing what it's goingto be used for and that's reallydisempowering for the user particularlysomeone who experiences mental healthchallenges we need to help to developsystems um procedures policies in waysthat people can be empowered to takecharge of what's happening to their dataand to their lives rather than feelingsubjected to ticking boxes for terms andconditions and that becoming how ourmental health system op operates sureyeah I was just going to say I thinkthis all kind of circles back to whatwe've all been talking about in terms ofmaking sure that the lived experienceinvolvement is there from the beginningand that um consumers people with livedexperience are really driving thisagenda and driving the development ofthese tools and that it's all aboutchoice right so there there may be arole for certain types of AI um or datadriven tools to play in the mentalhealth care System but we always need tohave a choice about how they're usedwhether we're involved in thatdevelopment whether our data is beingused for that um and consent is one waywe could tackle that um but yeah the thegreater the inclusion of people withlived experience the better and that'ssomething we can definitely work on Ithink in Australia butworldwide oh it reminds me of I actuallywrote something a few years ago for themental health blog I may have heard ofthat uh patients as domain experts inartificial intelligence mental healthresearch um because when you think aboutjust like designing mental health appsyou have co-designing you haveinvolvement of people with LIFexperience but it's a it's a lessexplored area of AI mental health stuffnot just you know the the user interfacedesign and things like that but theunderly AI Technologies and involving umclients and that and people with liexperience in the development of thoseumTechnologies so I think that's a veryinteresting area that needs to befurther explored um with regards toconsent bringing in Notions of um Ithink this new Dynamic informed consentif you're going to be collecting a lotof data about someone um that may beused down the track even as new modelsdevelop and things like that then theyshould periodically be given a reminderhey reconsent to this and things likethat it's just a a much vaster scalethan we've had prior to this you knowgratification of Healthum one old play Maybe devil's advocatehere or something uhin mental health or in s physical healthif you you tell somebody they have acondition like there's a medical testfor it and I say oh no I don't no Idon'tum it's sort of um well what do you dolike you've got some tests which isindicating that they've got thiscondition and they're just claiming thatthey don't whereas in the mental healtharea it's much more subjective and it'sveryexperiential so I I always I in thatblog that I alluded to I had thishypothesized a scenario that if you hadthis like Oracle kind of predictor DPdigital phenotyping machine that sort ofpredicted somebodywill you know sort of develop acondition in a few months and they saidno I won't no I won't I don't I don'tfeel problematic at all that's just aninteresting sort of thought experimentthat when you've got a tension I supposebetween some objective prediction systemversus somebody's own testimonial claimsabout no I feel fine nothing's going tohappen happen tome what should take forSS do people do that do people getdiagnosed with a condition and say Idon't have that oh I don't know I'm justsaying that as an example as likeif yeah like you might have a you know atest clinical test that actually showsyou have this condition that's all yeahI think I think I yeah I I do thinkthere's challenges in Psychology I thinkall of us would agree with this like thediagnos criteria what does it even meanlike what even is depression I meangenuinely there's been a lot ofskepticism around this now from verysenior academics around the world reallyquestioning at its core does thetraditional medical model if you haveheart failure or your heart conditiondoes that apply to mental health whatreally is the symptoms we're taking amuch more trans diagnostic approach Ithink the field of psychology ischanging a lot in a good way and that'sevolving whether a disease really existsand what its symptoms really are butthat makes AI even harder and I think italso gives us the potential that AIcould potentially unlock new ways ofunderstanding different types ofdisorders yeah I think we see that alittle bit in that context like I am apsychologist I'm definitely a with transdiagnostic approach in terms ofunderstanding what are the underpinningcognitive behavioral physiologicalmechanisms that are predisposingsomeone's symptoms rather thanconstraining them to a diagnostic modeland I mean one thing that um my team iscurrently doing is trying to use NLP totry and detect some of the underlyingfeatures of in this context traumanarratives which predispose someonetowards having symptoms of depression oranxiety or PTSD following a umdistressing event and so this kind ofmore unsupervised learning approach ishelping us to move Beyond theories thatpsychologists have cons given us andthat our research has been constrainedby to take a more data driven approachidentify new predisposing factors orunderlying mechanisms that mighteventually be targets for new novelintervention that we currently knownothing about so there is potential yesso the potential essentially to employunsupervised machine learning methodsbecause the sort of standard umsupervised machine learning methodsrequire training data sets and requirewhat you know is termed a ground oftruth I suppose and for something likepredicting uh house real estate pricesfor the coming year the ground truth isrelatively straightforward they justhouse prices and things like that asyou've mentioned in um uh Psypsychiatric taxonomy and things likethat that's um question you know that'ssort of not black and white to beginwith the grand truth itself is so yeahopen to to um discussion I'm excitedabout that that's so exciting we'reexcitedtoo but I think in I do want to answeryour question about if you tell someonethey're on they're going to develop wetried that without Ai and if you if youtell a human beingwe made the mistake of saying to a humanbeing you're on track to develop amental health disorder you don't haveone right now but you're on track todevelop it and the people who receivethat information versus nothing wereless likely to go and get help for theircare and again that taught me abouthuman behavior which is that humansdon't go to care until they're in crisisand if you give someone information thatthey're at risk of developing a disorderoften they think oh well I don't have ityet and so I'm I don't know peoplealready don't do that whendon't Dev issue I'm how will beyond thatright and it's the you know inclinationthat at the end of the day will beprioritized yeah humans wait most peoplewait until they're in crisis to seekcare okay um I'll just we'll go toquestions in a few minutes uh I'll justfinalize if anyone wants to talk aboutchatbots a bit more you're you're freeto uh because I did pose that questionwhat are their Contour what are theirlimits I I I feel like sorry just theykind ofum this goes back to a point that thisis such a a wild west territory andthere's so much thinking and researchand years of you know checking thesestuff out that needs to be donethat um for it to sort of too promptlyor quickly go into I suppose techcompanies and that that want to developthese for certain motives than that Ilike I would like for this stuff to juststay for a while in the Waters ofAcademia and that and just you know whatI mean to just nut it out nut it outover years before we go any furtherChap's been one of them where it's allthe rage you know I see people onTwitter I've got you know my latestchatot it's going to solve everyone'sloneliness and stuffand yeah yeah look so I haven't done anyresearch specifically on chatot so justa disclosure on that um but I am someonewho's accessed therapy right soPsychotherapy I'm someone who'sextensively accessed Psychotherapy so myviews on chatbots I mean many of thesame issues that apply to digital phenotyping applied to chatbots and whetherthat's issues around privacy or issuesaround um you know how testimony isevaluated by um how patient testimony isevaluated by the chatot or by theclinician um so my view you talked a bitabout the digital Therapeutic Allianceas someone who has engaged with therapymy view on whether or not chatbots candeliver something anywhere near what weget when we engage with a humantherapist and when we get that space tofeel heard and to feel supported and towork through whatever issue it is thatwe've come to work through I just don'tthink they're going to be able todeliver that um and I think there is thepotential that um we are distracted bythe potential of chatbots plugging a gapum and distracted from the fact thatactually we have a a Workforce shortageand we need to be addressing that andthat people um develop as you kind ofalluded to with replica um you knowquite unhealthy relationships withchatbots um that would harm them in someway um whether that's because thechatbot is discontinued or because therelationship itself becomes a toxicrelationship they just changed thesitting on at once and I changed thepersonal key personality aspect of itthat left a lot of people devastated orsomething I don't know can I expand onthat um I think those are reallyimportant considerations and so I don'tuh so conflict of interest disclosureI'm involved in developing an AI systemwhich would commonly be called a chatbotto deliver um cognitive behavioraltherapy uh exercises anyway and the waythat we've been thinking about it is notto replace humans but to try and get itsome of that Workforce issue so um Iworked in Britain for a long time um andthe NHS has this stepped model of carewhere um we have a really really highnumber of people who experience mildmoderate presentations of depression andanxiety and at the moment what a lot ofthose people get under Medicare or underhere in Australia and then in Britainunder the NHS system is this self-guidedCBT those digital programs that Imentioned which have no humaninteraction or no you know AI assistantto give you support or to give you anexample when you can't think ofsomething and help you complete thesevery static forms um and so I thinkthere is a role for having AI assistantsthat can help people to do things thatthey would traditionally be doing ontheir own that are these kind of FirstStep self-guided interventions whichwould be AI assisted because we werealways going to have those presentationswhich are more complex that need thathuman touch and that human interactionand sometimes for some people that lowerlevel AI assistant might be enough toget them going or get them to a pointwhere they reach out for help um or getthem between their sessions with a witha human psychologist um and so I don'tthink that we'll ever replace that butwe could potentially use these AIinterventions to free out time for thehuman Workforce to really focus on thosepresentations that needed great I agreeI agree completely and I think theexample that you actually sh saw in yourslides was so so so sweet because it'ssuch a I have a problem and it's exactlythis thing and I need exactly thissolution and the chat bot's excellent atdoing that but most human beings withmental health issues by Nature itdoesn't matter if you're reran or Yan orthird wave or what your philosophy ofpsychology is you come into therapy withdefenses defense mechanisms you don'trecognize your own biases you don'tunderstand fully the things you'veexperienced you don't always recognizehow your own be you know behavior isharmful you have delusions aboutyourself and that's the therapist's jobto pull those things out and a chatbotwill never be able to do that because itjust is too kind of pragmatic andgrounded you know away from from thatthat grayness that is a human being so Ithink for Simple Solutions like thatit's a very elegant solution but for theactual complex therapeutic word it'simpossible to imagine how a chat bootcould say I noticed that you know youyou had you know I've noticed a defensemechanism in you I just can't imaginethat wouldhappen Okay well uh thank you forconverging towards these very sensiblepoints and that's kind of nice isn't itto see that we didn't discuss beforehandso this is not Prem never metpreorganizedwe have about 15 pre-organized we've gotabout 15 minutes for Q&amp;A so I'll walkaround um if anyone hasquestions thank you uh veryenlightening now You' alluded to theworsening mental health situation insociety at large and I'll try and keepthis quick but what this seems to to mehere is that we have a dam that's burstwe have you know nine of the 10 largestcompanies in the world are AI companiesGoogle is gathering 80 or 90% of thedata you guys are talking about anywayalready and whereas lawyersdoctors um any clinical practitioner oraccountant is privy to privilegedinformation and has a very wellregulated and protected responsibilityto to their patients or theirclients and that is protected and guidedthese largerentities have just a fiduciaryresponsibility to a shareholder andwhere we previously externalized harmsto Nature now we're externalizing harmsby monetizing attention and you don'tget to a meaningful definition of whatit means to be human without talkingabout Free Will andattention so I sort of see this as Damhas burst we're running around herebeing very sensible with a few sandbagsgoing we should place these carefullybecause the entire town is flooding yeahis there like what is the role that thementalhealth industry Society can take inarguing for Upstreaminterventions regulatorily to say anyonewho's got access to this sort of dataneeds to have theresponsibilities that mental healthprofessionals right like we're creatinga crisis because of this there you gothat's theframe I think there are two things thereI think you named the solution one isthat we need to be doing more to try andenforce regulatory protections um we'restarting to see a little bit of that sothe eu's AI act came into place inAugust which means that within the EU umlarge language models it needs to bedisclosed what data that being beingtrained on and that's going to be partof trying to get out what are thesethings actually doing the other thingthat I myself as a mental healthclinician have grappled with is we needto stop being so scared and startactively being part of the solutionbecause this stuff's going to happenaround us and without us if we're notcareful we actively need to step forwardand say if not me who we need to beworking with these companies to makesure that what they are developing isevidence-based because when it comes tothings like chatbook if it's deliveringsomething which is not an Evidence basedhelpful intervention it's going to stoppeople going to get therapy because Idid therapy bot and it didn't work andif that's not therapy it could havereally damaging consequences so I thinkwe need to really head on face our ownfears be part of the solution and notrun around withsandbags and then I yeah the only thingI would add is that I think in answer towho who's going to stand up to the techcompanies I actually think that's thebusiness of philosophy you knowpsychology is the business of humanbeings who are experiencing mentalhealth symptoms and when it gets beyondthat and big tech companies are changingwhat it means to be human that's wherewe need philosophy like please stand upyeah well I mean I'm here I'm here I amhelp yeah to trying to trying to do someadvocacy yeah so I agree like I think Imean I think there is a role for theprofession to play I also think there'sa role for for philosophy to playthere's some work there as well in termsof um the discipline traditionally haskind of not being Keen to advocate forcertain policy agenda genders and thingslike that and I think that's changing Ithink we're seeing more philosophers whoreally carefully think about the policyimplications of their work and getinvolved in that but actually I thinkthis is everyone's responsibility all ofus at some point will likely be affectedby mental health we are all victims ofbig Tech who are tracking us andmonitoring us so as much as it is peoplein certain professions who can work onum you know consultation with governmentresponses to those um just as a generalcitizen you can get involved if you'repassionate about this you know you canspeak to your local MP you can starttaking you know an active role in thisissue and getting your voicesheard great thankyou thank you I just kind of want to goback to that idea of self-fulfillingefficacy um and as a practitioner I seethis coming out with ADD people self-diagnosing in this area um you know myphone is on it's listening to me type ofthings I'm scrolling through Instagramand about every fourth ad has somethingto do with ADDADHD um and especially around sort ofthe younger even 40 and lower um a lotof people saying well I did a test ineight out of 10 I definitely have ADD umand I'm not anti-ai in any way but howdo we sort of curve that sense of youknow AI told me therefore I am um wherepeople are not only using it to um labelthem themselves but U more dangerouslyexcuse themselves from learning how tomanage their behavior effectivelybecause it's become a crutch instead ofatool that's that's a that's a hard oneum yeah I I I wonder though U so I don'tdisagree I think you know obviouslythere's huge problems with umpersonalized ADV you know all of thataside I think that more informationthough about people's possible MentalHealth is a good thing I don't I think Ithink Society needs more information andit probably is not a good idea that itcomes from Tik Tok but I do think moreum we are in a new phase of moreawareness around things likeneurodiversity around all the differentmental health conditions that we'vepreviously had a lot of stigma andsilence around so I I think this kind ofproblem that you're speaking of I don'tknow the solution but I do think it isin reaction to Consumers not havingpatients not having enough informationabout their mental health and beinglocked out of a system not able toaccess the care that they need beingsilenced or being um you know ostracizedin some way so yeah that doesn't answeryour question but I do have a skepticismaround that because I think if peopleare coming more and saying I think Imight have this thing I've seen thisinformation I don't necessarily see thatit's a bad thing so it's a balancedconversation Isuppose okay um we'll movealong um thank you for the veryinformative talk um and theconversations uh my name is Delani I'mone of the psychiatrist I do do ADHDassessments and I just have somethingmore to add I think you talked about umhow do we discuss with patients if theydecide that they don't have a conditionwhat we are dealing with at the momentis the complete opposite they go throughTik Tok they come with their owndiagnosis and also sometimes with themedication and they come and see you andthey're totally convinced that they haveADHD but you talk to them for one and ahalf hours or so and then you realizethey have trauma history domesticviolence they've had so many attachmentrelated trauma drug and alcohol abuse somany different aspects of it and ittakes such a long time to convince themthat they actually don't have that andit's a totally different thing and AImight be very black and white but humanbeings have so many different gray areasof life so it takes a lot of time Ithink I'm I'm not complaining if you seemy new sports car you you know why so Ihave lots of referrals coming throughbut um I feel really sorry sometimesthough because you keep on getting Ithink the referrals have gone up about400%just for ADHDassessments um but it takes such a longtime to convince someone there's lotmore work to do in your own mentalhealth than just going and getting a rlein and all your problems are going to befixed so I think um it's a very complexproblem I agree we all need to betogether I personally don't think TheRegulators are doing much um my you knowFacebook feed and Instagram is full ofumADHD kind of information and it's kindof always on your face as well it'sreally hard not to be not in that spaceso that's just one addition to that inin terms of how AI can help as apsychiatrist what I have noticed is thatespecially arounddocumentation I found AI to be the mostimportant tool I have had within thelast at least 10 years of my practiceum prior to AI I would say um I used tospend all weekend sometimes just writingnotes writing letters to GPS writingCourt reports uh filling out ndisapplications now you know I actuallyhave a weekend thanks to that so um it'shelpful we just need to use it in a veryuseful way I think that's my two senseword thank youthose humble administrative tasks for agood start it's not very sexy it's notthat cool science but it's the mosthelpful thing it's a good startdefinitely uhyeah thank you for the verythought-provoking conversation and um soI'm wondering whether there is anotherpossibility of is there potential forimplementing AI into uh providing psychoeducation as well as reducing stigmabecause from speaking from personalexperience I'm a psych currentpsychology student I'm aspiring tobecome a psychologist and um I'm AsianAustralian background and I know thatfor a fact that within our communitythere is this vast really deep root ofstigma that people are refusing to admitthat they are struggling with mentalhealth and that they are in severecrisis and they're affecting youngadults like me especially family membersand that they are affecting our livesevery day and I'm wondering is there apossibility that because they arebecause of that sort of denial of theirmental health struggles they will refuseto go to a psychologist or apsychiatrist and perhaps using I AIwould that actually perhaps like becausethey don't need to disclose anything toa human being would that actually haveanything I would just love to know anyopinions on that thank you I would sayyes um I think that's a potentiallyreally good application of AI is forpsycho education so psycho education forthose who don't know what it is it's umunderstanding about the symptoms and CAcauses of mental health challenges andoften it comes in the forms of like aPDF that you your GP might give you forexample um getting around stigma by umfor example um with the the umapplication that we're developing youcan access it through applications thatyou already have on your phone so thingslike WhatsApp or um messenger Facebookmatter messenger um as a way to try andaccess the information without having todownload a you know Mentor whole therapyapp or to have to actively um seek outmental health support um as one way totry and get that information intoplatforms that people are alreadyaccessing voluntarily um to try and findum the information that they need so Ithink there is really good applicationsthere I'd really love to see moreresearch in this area actually so ifyou're thinking about pursuing umpsychology or research ClinicalPsychology PhD please like research inthis area is needed because I I haven'talready formed a view on this I thinkthere um there are good Arguments forhow it could be beneficial I also I'mworried about the potential for it tojust reinforce that stigma bymaintaining um hidden narratives and nottherefore being able to for people tofeel like they can talk about things outin the open so I don't I don't actuallyhave a firm view on this I think itwould be great to see more research andto hear more how people experience umthose apps and what what they feel ifit's helpful definitely I think thecontent is really important there aswell in showing that it's encouragingpeople to talk about it encouragingpeople to seek help to go and seeprofessionals and that's a reallyimportant role that any digital mentalhealth intervention needs to have toencourage connection with a human umbecause we don't want to contribute tothe stigma I've seen a lovely analog umpopulation where they developed a chatbot for youth who have were questioningtheir sexuality which is a time whereyou often don't feel safe speak to ahuman being for whatever reason whetherit's cultural or you're not ready to andthere was a really lovely paper showingthat that had benefit because theyweren't ready to speak to a human so yesI do think there's instances where achat bot could fill that Gap wherespeaking to a human is not safe orwanted or needed at thatmoment sorry this side we we'll hangabout if you've got questions afterwardsyeah hi um yeah so I just wanted to I Iguess firstly just give my my own littledisclosure as a psychologist teachingother clinicians how to use AI ineveryday practice um I just want to justcheck how do we overcome this veryoverwhelming negative bias towards allthe Doom and Gloom stories around AI allthe bad uses all the ways it's goingwrong and a Terminator type scenariosout an exaggeration um because you knowI think there are so many everyday usesaround hyper individualizing treatmentum providing scenarios providingdedicated psycho education around youknow better supporting people on anindividual level um you know theself-care benefits for clinicians or theways we can better support clients umyou know we don't go and say nobodyshould drive a car because there werebad drivers driving badly havingaccidents you know we see overall abenefit for good drivers driving well toserve everyday Society so how do weovercome this overwhelming negative biasaround bad people soorry people usingfor nefarious purposes incorrectpurposes in a way that is not howSociety is encouraged to be able to morepositively moveforward it's just evidence I thinkthat's my sense just speaking as ascientists I think just more evidencethat it's safe and effective andfeasible and more case studies of thoseI think would be really beneficial Imean yeah it was only 20 months ago Idon't know I'm losing track of how longwe're counting but it's still so newless than two years and so evidence Basis just trying to catch up I think andjust PE teaching people how todrive safely and responsibly andethically yeah I mean I agree absolutelyyou think the evidence base needs to bethere which it's not it's emerging atthe moment but there's you know quitelimited evidence in the space butactually I also I think it depends whatum like what circles you're in becausein the kind of research that I did a lotof the papers were Pro very positivewith no negative bias it would just havelike a tiny section of ethicalimplications and that would be it but itwas all like yes benefits yay so I thinkit can depend you know where you'reoperating who you are who you'reinteracting with and what the views ofthe people around youare it's an interesting question aboutthe car thing I don't it justorganically happened with cars I supposeI don't think people were thinking atthe start how do we convince people thatPros outweighs the Cons with cars theyjust developed naturally and we reachthis sort of stability point maybe thatwill happen with AI um just quick Pointyeah andI'll very quick comment with cars therewas the horse and carriage Lobby that inthe UK that had people walking in frontof the cars with flags what we're seeinghere is because it's an arms race peoplealso want to control the space so a lotof this conversation is eitheradvertising how powerful it's going toget how quickly and trying to lock thebehind the horse that's already boltedand governments trying to get controlover the application of everybody elsewhile still pulling resources into themilitary and all sorts of unethicalapplications themselves so it's a landgrab Mo first and foremost and it'sMarketing in and of itself so if you'relooking for how to apply it in your ownpractice then do the research for theways and yes look at the unint sideeffects but just trust that thetechnology can address things but as wassaid here previously you know there'ssomething in human connectionthat yeah you don't necessarily want toforgetabout uh I just put a positive spin tothisconversation um I know of at least threecompanies in the US that are coming upwith the complete digital therapist thatwill do complete CBD right and um I'malso working with UNICEF and in EasternEurope we have a lot of uh scenarios andcountries where clinicians themselvesare not trained in CBT or otherevidence-based therapies uh which leadsus to no choice but to investigatefurther into building a digitaltherapist so just to if I I've been toldthat we don't have much time but uh onlyone of theseum CBT based tools have been releasedusing generational you know generativeAI uh if you're interested I'm happy topass on that information uh but it's allhappening within three years you willhave the evidence because information ischanged within the last three monthsthat has made significant differences inthis field so yeah thank you yeah I hopeyou haven't sounded negative I think themain point is just yeah if that's greatall we need is evidence I think is themainthing and I think the benefits for underresourced um situations just cannot beemphasizedenough okay just a last question unlessyou got a few more but um just a followup from this gentleman on the Doom andGloom narrative it is true Steph we dogo to these talks and it's constant Doomand Gloom so I appreciate that you'veonly heard the positive but we we alwayshear the doom and I'm just wonderingjust following from I can't remember whomentioned it maybe it was Olivia maybeit was um the other lady of your namebut maybe we need to be asking differentquestions like for example doespsychology need to examine itself firstbecause we've had this mental ill healthproblem for a very very long time evenbefore AI became sexy so should we belooking at what's not working locallyeven prior to the AO tools beingimplemented absolutely and then also umyou know can we use AI to actually guidepsychologists like not so maybe ShiftingThe Narrative um it's like in the senseof the client's not so the so-calledvulnerable partner here but let's lookat what maybe the clinician can dobetter to level the hierarchy that hasexisted prior to the implementation ofAI between the clinician and the clientso perhaps just asking differentquestions if that makes sense as opposedto or how can we just up the anti ofwhat we're already doing with ourclinical toolsI agreecompletely yeah and I think a lot of theum a lot of at least some of the ethicalissues that these tools present are justreplications of what might already behappening in clinical practice as aresult of um under resource or powerhierarchies that are not being welladdressed so yeah I absolutely agreethat we can ask different questions inlook of what we alreadydone I think it's a good opportunitytaking be outside of the therapy room byusing Ai and that gives the user morecontrol over when and where and how theyengage in therapeutic principlestoo thanks so much for the talk reallyloved it I'm studying a masters inpositive psychology here and for thosethat might not know positive psychologyis a study of human flourishing I'mlooking at what we can learn from theoutliers to then bring the whole averageup but a challenge we have there is thatum there isn't the same burning platformuh if you're a three out of 10 youreally do want to get better but ifyou're a seven out of 10 trying toconvince someone that if you domeditation you'll be an 8.5 is quitehard but I've been curious to know aboutI'm sort of how some companies likehappify using sort of nudging so thatwhen people they notice they're youabout to go to sleep have a a nudge todo a gratitude's intervention I'm so I'mcurious to understand your Reflectionson how the tech could enable this sortof positive psychology side and is theresort of less ethical implications therefor capturing data given that it's notum sort of capturing vulnerable data soI'm curious onthat yeah so I think there's definitelypotential for that to be positive andfor that to be used in a way that umpeople have control over and people findis beneficial for them and results inthem feeling a greater sense ofwell-being I think the data collectionprobably still raises a similar degreeof ethical concern in terms of what itdepends on what kind of information isbeing tracked but information is beingtracked about a person inside their homein their day-to-day life and thendepending on as we've heard theregulation isn't there right around bigtech companies and private um companiesoperating in that space who can then usethis data share this data sell this datafor whatever purposes they determine isnecessary for their commercial interestsand so your data that may be kind oftangent attached to your mentalwell-being but still you know has somesome content some substantive contentcan end up being sold to a company thatyou never envisaged and we might want tobe worried aboutthat we got time for a couple morequestions oh hey my name is Desi um I'veworked in a sexual assault service formany years and it's kind of a famoussupport model of supporting people'sagency and there's a lot of um groupwork that happens and um they're usingAI tools to help facilitate supportgroups it's been really useful becausean AI bot can kind of timecontributions much better than a humancan make sure people all equ um equallycontribute which has been really greatum but with feminism often um sexualviolence against women is put on abroader political kind of it's not anindividual mental health problem it'slike a lot of our mental health comesfrom a capitalist culture that's reallytoxic so um so I'm kind of you knowinterested in how mental health or howAI is going to change society ratherthan individual mental health or ifthat's a field at allum yeah yeah I I think both of thosequestions are linked to each otherthanks for sharing um and I thinkagain you know the traditional field ofpsychology is when something goes wrongin in our mental health and I think whatyou're talking about both of youactually are talking about AI in termsof anthropology sociology philosophy andall these other really important fieldsthat speak to things that happening insociety and how to live well as a humanbeing I personally don't think that'sthe business of traditional psychologywe're in the business of when things gowrong and so I'd love to see a panel onAI in anthropology AI in sociology AI ingendered politics I I think we need todo that more and I I don't have anyanswers but I'd come to thatpanel great Point um yes that's a greatpoint you have one more question andthen we can take the other questions offstage because we're going to be here foryou know 15 more minutes afterward okayso I'm not even going to give a questionum so my name is Simon Dennis I'm in thesame company with Caitlyn um we'vetalked a lot about the research and Ijust wanted to advertise a couple ofresearch projects one that's umcurrently running and another one thatwill be coming up so um currently I'mdoing uh a study with um with masters ofProfessional Psychology students lookingat clinicians um attitudes towardsgenerative Ai and and there what we'redoing is we're um concentrating on whatare the appro use cases and then alsohow clinicians view the risks andbenefits and and we're looking for anyum mental health support people of anyum description who might be interestedin being involved in that um studybecause we're we're really trying to getas many views as we can in that um andthen the other thing I just wanted tomention is that Caitlyn's also about tobe leading a um a new study in the useof of generative AI in these um chatbotscenarios um in your full clinical trialso we're certainly hoping to to um youtest test out the efficacy um andengagementthere okay so thank you for that thankyou for all coming and thanks for ourpanelists who will clut of ApplauseSor and thank you to Simon for bringingus all together yes thank you there'ssome drinks there we

      <td>Review of Clinical Notes AI: Mental health progress note generator</td>
      <td>do you want to write progress noteswithout actually having to writeprogress notes it sounds too good to betrue but this AI progress note generatorclaims that it will save you hours oftime and frustration each month I'vetested it out and I'm here to share theresults with you hi I'm Dr Melissamcaffrey founder of the free PrivatePractice paperwork crash course andtoday I am giving you my full review ofthe AI platform called clinical notes AIthis is part of our series reviewing avariety of AI progress note generatorsand we're using the same criteria toreview all of them these criteria arehow does it actually work pricingpotential integration with your currentnote taking system or electronic healthrecord my favorite features any cautionsor concerns and finally how well does itactually write a progress note before wedive in I want to give you my fulldisclaimer I am not affiliated withclinical notes AI in any way this is notany kind of AD and I've chosen not toreceive any compensation from any ofthese AI platform reviews this is my ownreview from my perspective and Irecommend that you use it as one of themany pieces of information that you usein making your decision about whether ornot to choose this platform okay nowthat we have disclaimers out of the waylet's get into the actual review so howdoes clinical notes AI actually workit's pretty interesting option one isthat it will transcribe your session butunlike some of these other platforms itdoesn't actually record that session sofor example you log into the system andallow it to listen in on your sessionwith your client it will then create atranscription of what's happening butnot record the audio instead it createsa written summary and then at the end itwill analyze the transcript it createdso you don't have to worry about itsaving any of that that information oractually recording sessions but it doesgive a full written transcript the otherway you can use clinical notes AI is todictate your note and in the same way itwill then write down everything you'vesaid and then analyze the summary ofthat the cool thing is that it's abetter form of dictation so you canactually tell it things like oh I forgotto put this sentence in a differentsection or I want to include thesetopics after the fact so you can kind oftalk to it like a person instead of justtalking to it and having it write downliterally everything you say now thatall sounds pretty fancy so how much doesit cost there are quite a few pricingoptions and I'm just going to give youthe overview not like every littledetail of what's included in all ofthese but you can try it out for freefor the first 10 sessions after that youcan pay just $15 a month and that willgive you up to 20 live sessions that youcan record Bo then it goes to $30 amonth for 40 live sessions and for $50 amonth you get unlimited everything nowwe link to clinical notes AI in thedescription of this video so if you wantto look at all of the details around thepricing options you can check that outthere our next criteria how well will itintegrate with your current notetakingsystem or your electronic health recordwell basically it's not going tointegrate with it you're going to usethe copy paste method which spoileralert is the case for most of theseplatforms at this point it does give youthe option to either download theprogress note as a PDF or you can easilycopy paste and it has different sectionsin the note template which we're goingto talk about in a minute you can eitheruh copy paste just a section or you cancopy paste the entire thing that it hasproduced for you all right so now whatare some of my favorite features fromusing this product one I really likethat they do emphasize consent from theclient so they specifically address thiswhen uh you log in as the clinician andalso every time you're doing a note itsays that you have reviewed that withthem and that the client has consentedto using AI as part of the note-takingprocess they also give you a templatethat is a form you can use with clientsand this is really great because it'ssomething you can use to review withclients and see if they have anyquestions about the process and makesure that they consent to using AI aspart of their recordkeeping before youactually start doing it another thing Ilike about clinical notes AI is thatit's not actually recording yoursessions so there's no audio that'sbeing saved which I think could be apotential drawback for many cliniciansneeding to worry about whether or notthat information is being deleted aswell as for clients who wouldn't wanttheir actual session recorded and assomeone who is not really very good withdictation I really like like that it'smore of a scribe system uh in theirdictation feature so you don't have toplan ahead what you're going to say andsay it in a certain order you can kindof skip around and just talk about whathappened in your session if you want touse that dictation feature and then itwill know how to clean up what you havetold it about the session so you couldjust talk to your computer and throw outideas throw out quotes that maybe youwrote down on a piece of paper duringthe session and just list them all offin whatever order you want and then tellit where to put it and it will do thatfor you there are also lots of optionsfor different types of note templatesthat you can use I do think that thisdepends on the paid plan that you'reusing um but one of the Fairlyinexpensive paid plans did offer thisand you get a variety of templatesthings like soap or dap or gerp or youcan just use a bullet point Pointsummary it will also create like aconversational summary so it gives youlots of options of how you want toformat the progress note and if you'veseen any of my other videos then youknow that I love it gives you theinformation in bullet points and itoffers you a bullet point summary youalso have the option to include adiagnosis which it will extract fromthat session and give you suggestionsfor or and you can include symptoms andanother thing I thought was really coolis it lets you describe the clienthowever you want so I typically sayclient um just as a personal preferencebut you could also say patient and youcould also say individual or student Ithink all of those were options so nowlet's get into some of the cautions andconcerns so one of the biggest things isthat in order for you to be hipacompliant even though clinical notes AIis a HIPPA secure system for you to beHippa compliant while using it you needto download to baa a business associateagreement however at least at this pointwhile I'm reviewing clinical notes AIthey don't offer that right off the batyou have to email them and ask for itnow when I emailed them they gave it tome right away it was the same day um butyou just want to know that right awayyou can't just go in and start using ituntil you've gotten that baa from themand you've signed it another thing wasthat it did take a few minutes togenerate the progress note um again noneof these paid platforms that I havetested are nearly as fast as chat GPTbut chat GPT is not hipos secure so weare not going to use that for ourprogress notes now my biggest cautionwas actually that it generated a reallylong progress note if you've seen myother videos you know that I am usingthe Gloria session with Carl Rogers asan example of how it will write aprogress note now that session is onlyonly 30 minutes long and I had like a 2and 1 half page progress note I meanwhen I say it created a summary it waslike a whole summary that was like halfof a transcript it's well organized it'sin bullet point format it's fairly easyto read but if it were me personally Iwould probably cut out like half of thatinformation another thing was that itdid create a plan for a future sessionand assumed that a next session washappening even though that was neverdiscussed and none of that informationwas presented to the AI progress nodegenerator now this seems to be a commonissue with a lot of these platforms andmakes sense because they are meant fortherapists who are seeing clients weeklyU but it's you know something to payattention to that it is including thatassuming that will happen and notnecessarily because it did happen onthat note the plan section was actuallyvery long and had many many bulletpoints to it and that's a littleconcerning when when you consider thatthere was actually no plan or nodiscussion in any way of a plan for howto move forward and my last concern isthat while all of these options for howto formulate the note and which sectionsto use in that template are amazing andI love having options my experiencetells me that a lot of clinicians willsit and obsess over which sections toadd and which sections might have thisbullet point versus this bullet pointand end up spending a lot more time bothactually writing the note but also justthinking about what needs to go in thenote and the point of these platforms isto take a lot of that concern away fromyou so let's talk about how well itactually wrote the progress note andI'll give you my suggestions for whichsections I would use so I chose to usetwo different note templates for thesame session so that we could comparethem I did one dap note which stands fordata assessment and planand one soap note which stands forsubjective objective assessment and planwith each of those I added a couple ofthe other options to see what thosethings did like the conversationalsummary individual summary and bulletpoints I already told you it created areally long progress note so that wasthe case the soap note I didn't do inbullet point form so it was a little bitshorter but again when it's multipleparagraphs you're still not getting avery readable progress note so that wasone of my biggest concerns with the twoprogress notes that I generated is thatthey were pretty long as most of theseplatforms do it actually generated avery excellent summary so if you'resomeone who tends to write more or youhave certain clients with whom you liketo write more I could see this beingreally beneficial it also actually madesuggestions for a diagnosis and theywere pretty spoton and they actuallygave a little bit of a rationale with itrelated to the symptoms that were listedin the note I also liked that it didhave a disclaimer that the clinicianreally needs to determine whether or notthat diagnosis is appropriate nowbecause these progress note templateshave so many options for what you caninclude there is a lot of crossover so Idid find that a few of the sections ineach of the progress notes werebasically covering the exact same thingfor example the data section the bulletpoint summary and the individual detailssection all included the sameinformation so you really only need topick one of those if I were usingclinical notes AI to write my progressnotes I would do a Dap note but I wouldadd symptoms and the individual detailsand then the only four sections I wouldactually use from the note would beassessmentplansymptomatology and individual details tome those four things would create anexcellent summary and give youeverything that you would need for bothan insurance progress note and just areally good progress note in general andI would still probably end up cuttingout half of the information in thosesections because again it's reallydetailed so it's important that you doreview what is in the progress note todetermine if it's necessary to be in theprogress note there's always a balanceof determining you know is there toomuch or too little and while I do thinkthat adding more information is probablybetter than less that's not always thecase so just make sure that you areactually reviewing the information ineach progress note now I know you wantto see these progress notes for yourselfand you can just click on the link thatwill be in the description below andI'll send you a copy of that dap noteand that soap note that clinical notesAI wrote for Carl Rogers session withGloria it also includes my personalnotes on it with some feedback

      <td>Role of AI in improving mental health | Saira Dua | TEDxLotus Petal School</td>
      <td>Transcriber: Azizia Salma\nReviewer: Manlin FangOur next speaker is a\ndynamic young studentfrom Pathways School, Gurugramwho blends creative writing,AI and psychology to address\nmental health challenges.She is also the founder and host\nof the Mind Unraveled podcast,where she energetically explores\nmental health topics.Ms. Saira Dua is an author of two books\nand a co-author of another two.She has created the world's first emoji\nbased book addressing social anxietyfor adolescents. Please join me in\nwelcoming Ms. Saira Dua to the stage.6 million people helped and\na 31% drop in depression,all thanks to artificial intelligence\nor AI. Impressive isn't it?These were the numbers reported\nby the official Wysa website.But wait, what is Wysa?\nIt’s not just a blue owl,but it's an AI powered platform\nthat actually talks to youand helps you manage tough times.This is just one example of how AI can\nmake a real difference in our world today,especially when it comes to community\nservice and mental health.The main idea is to understand\nthat AI is a powerful toolfor enhancing accessibility\nto mental health.Firstly, it breaks down complex\ntopics into simpler ones.Secondly, it enhances accessibility forthe deaf community by using \nreal time sign language translation.And it offers a sense of anonymity,which makes it easier for\nour students to lookfor help due to reduced fear\nof judgment and stigma.Due to all these components, AI embodies\nthe essence of community service.In this AI driven world, what it means\nto be human is constantly evolving.Therefore, AI enhances how we absorb,\nlearn, connect, and support one another.It helps us tackle challenges that \nmake up our shared human experience.But how did I arrive at this combination\nof mental health and AI?Firstly, I observed a growing prevalence\nof mental health issues among adolescentsdue to a shortage of professionals.The Financial Express reported that\nthere were 0.07 psychologists per100,000 people in India, highlighting\na significant gap.However, technology was here\nto bridge this divide.Therefore, it was identified that\nAI can analyze emotional cuesand enhance diagnostic accuracy.Simultaneously, it can reduce stigma\nand use inclusive features.Now you're all school students, right?I'm sure at school we're often told about\nthe importance of community service,you know, helping out, volunteering\nor raising awareness.But have you ever thought, why not let AI help me \nin this community service project?Probably not, right? I hadn’t either,\nbut then I thought,if AI is becoming so rapidly\nprevalent in today's world,why not take advantage of it?So to begin with, AI is enhancing\naccessibility forthe impaired hearing community by using\nreal time translation. What is that?Basically, it takes sign language\nand converts it into writtenor spoken text. For example, Signly.Signly is a platform that utilizes\nadvanced AI to convertAmerican Sign Language into\nwritten or spoken text.This can be used in teletherapy sessions,which are basically \ncommunication sessions.This makes it very easy for a client and\na therapist to interact smoothly,because there are no physical\ninterpreters required.This is vital given the global shortage\nof certified interpreters.Another impressive superpower AI has \nis that it can enhance how you understand information.AI can make information easier\nand more simpler to understand,and it tailors the information\nperfectly to the audience.Picture this, a chatbot that’s like\na personal mental health buddy,always there and ready to listen\nto you. This is Woebot.It's a chatbot that uses natural\nlanguage processing,which is a component that makes \nAI sound more humanto chat with you in a relatable way.For example, when dealing\nwith stress, Woebot might say,imagine your stress is like a balloon.Let the air out slowly with\nsome deep breaths,turning a complex idea into\nsomething relatable.Additionally, it personalizes advice\nbased on what you share.As students, I'm sure we\nall have exams, right?So when you input that you have\nexams into the Woebot chatbot,what they will suggest is a well-balanced\nschedule for you.It also has mood tracking and\nself-reflection tools.A Woebot health analysis stated that there\nwas 24% reduction in overallwork impairment and burnout \ndue to the usage of this platform.Another point includes that AI has\nanonymity because it's a privateand anonymous space. \nSo this makes it easierfor students who are hesitant about\nin-person therapy.For example, Talkspace.Talkspace transforms how students access\nmental health care by using AI drivenscreening tools. Such as, you can answer\nquestions about sleep,mood levels or stress levels.But the real benefit of Talkspace \nlies in its anonymitybecause students who feel judgedor they feel uncomfortable doing in-person\ntherapy sessions will find iteasier to approach talkspace.A survey conducted by Talkspace\nstated that 80% ofthe users found it extremely effective,\nif not more effective,than traditional therapy.Nonetheless, let's be honest, there\nare certain tensions too.For example, AI has a risk of\nspreading misinformationand generating inaccurate advice.This is because without human oversight,\nit can misinterpret data inputs.But then again, this is only\nif AI is used in isolation.Understand, the key to leveraging AI\neffectively is using it as a support tool,complemented by thorough reviews\nby professionals.For example, Woebot usesWoebot uses mental health professionals\nto continuously refineand validate their information.This ensures that the information\nis accurate, empathetic,and remains grounded in\nclinical standards.Another concern is the risk of\noversimplifying information.AI might take complex mental health\nchallenges and reduce it into simple,basic definitions, which could be harmful\nfor people facing more in-depthand complex challenges. Although valid,it's important to recognise that there\nare safeguards against this.For example, Wysa uses advanced\nAI algorithms to make in-depthand context aware conversations.A study by the National Centre\nfor Biotechnology Informationcorroborated that Wysa reduces\ndepression by 31%,demonstrating its capability to handle\nsuch challenges and provide personalisedand effective support.Currently, AI is expanding\njob opportunitiesfor mental health professionals. How? Have you guys heard of Ellie?No, not your friend or some\nnext door neighbor,but an AI powered therapist that\ncan analyze emotional cues,facial expressions, and voice tones\nto detect emotions like anxietyand depression. This was developed bythe University of Southern California\nfor soldiers. This helps.This helps the mental health professionals\nto analyze subtle emotionalcues that could indicate emotions, such\nas post-traumatic stress disorder.Moreover, we need to understand that\nAI is not replacing therapists.It's expanding their scope.With tools like Ellie on the rise,we can see that there will bea growing demand of mental health\nprofessionals to train,develop and supervise tools\nlike Ellie. Overall, next time when you\n do community service,think about how you can\nuse AI specifically inthe field of mental health.A few takeaways we can note that are,firstly, AI is revolutionizing mental\nhealth care by improving accessibilityfor deaf people and for students too,because it's personalizing content\nfor students and using anonymity,which reduces judgment and stigma.Tools like Wysa, Signly, and Ellie\nutilize advanced AI algorithmsand tailored interactions to make mental\nhealth resources more approachable.Together, we can create a future\nwhere AI and compassion unite.Let's leverage AI effectively to transform\nmental health care. Thank you.</td>

that AI can serve as an additionto Conventional therapy and it it canaugment it but what's really reallyinteresting is what we just saw therewith limic that the NHS is now deployedacross many many parts of the NHS um interms of it talking therapies program isvery very different to what's in theguardian article okay and what theguardian focuses on and and it's reallyreally important to distinguish betweenthis firstly let's just give a bit ofcontext to our audience right demand fortherapy is really really high so umwaiting list you've got 20,000 people inthe UK that are off work every month formental ill health a quarter of people aquarter of patients seeking treatmentwait more than 90 days and about half ofthem deteriorate within that that timeand they were a global program so Ipulled out just a couple of stats justto just to tell people in the audiencehow severe this is so worldwide about 12billion work days 12 billion are lostevery single year due to depression andanxiety and the pandemic uh triggered a25% increase in um general anxiety anddepression so this is obviously a reallybig problem it's caught governmentsunprepared right they only spend about2% of their health budgets on mentalhealth and so how can AI help is thequestion so what we saw from the segmentthere was actuallyan an app that has got medical devicestatus right when it comes to

health and then the point is itaugments the process so then you you'vegot a clinician you've got an expertthat you can then see the differencethat that's there the guardian veryquickly is about the tens of thousandsof apps that are often unregulated rightchatbot friends where theyve find choosean app using GPT for example okay andpeople are finding solace in speaking tothese apps but there are all sorts ofissues with them so firstly you know isyour privacy maintained when you'retalking to these apps and actually therewas some sweeping reviews um andactually the Milla Foundation found thatum they looked at 32 popular mentalhealth apps and found 19 of them werefailing to safeguard a privacy and thenpsychologists make this point that if weend up in a world leis where your bestfriend is actually on your app andyou're going to this best friend AI totalk to them even about anxiety anddepression which by the way there are somany benefits of that in so in many wayspeople are very lonely who have a stigmawhen they think there's a stigma ofseeking therapy might go to the app theproblem is is that you might beexacerbating the fact that some peoplewon't then relate to humans at all cuzhumans are chaos chaotic and a bit messyum so yeah the story goes into that butthey're they're very very differentthings one sort of it's not regulatedand I think that's what the audiencehave to be very very clear aboutbrilliant thank you very much but thenyou have those regulated us yeah thankyou very much for making that pointclear very very important next story uman AI app claiming to detect SDI fromphotos of generals is a privacydisaster uh from Forbes there shall Itell you about this the problem withthis is that if you go to the websiteit's called Cala okay calmara um itencourages someone who's about to getinto an intimate situation so you'reyou're in that environment and for thefirst time maybe and you know things areheating up just sort of whip out yoursmartphoneand GL said smart whatever and take apicture of um male genitalia and um tosee if there's an STI now I think theproblem is there right STI are a massiveproblem 1 million pregnant womenestimated to be infected with syphilisin 2016 350,000 adverse um birthoutcomes there's all sorts of problemswith HPV so this is clearly a problemthat needs to be solved AI can help sothey use essentially computer visiontechniques and it's a an AI model coresegmentation where you look at forexample skin and you try and find in thepixels of a digital image an anomalyright so you're looking for a skinlesion okay and so the AI technology canabsolutely help but the problem is isthat firstly people posting images intothis app where there might be securityand privacy concerns um I startedreading it and thinking actually this ispotentially a very good use of machinelearning and AI but then I startedreading about the company and in theForbes article they claimed that thecompany itself said that it had someElite academic Partnerships that wasthen removed from their website onceforb started probing into it the the biguniversities have claimed that theydon't have a partnership with thecompany so you can start to see nowwhere apps are out there and unlessthere's a lot of transparency about howthey're working where the data is goingis there independent validation of thedata sets and then the model the AImodel being performance and all of thesethings it casts doubt upon the AI app'sclaims so be for for the audience theclear thing here is before submittingcertain photographs or any photographs Iwould say into these apps um you needyou need to privac private parts privacynightmare um yeah I mean you know theresearch I did for that that piece justthere I read I read the paper and sawall the images okay all right I'm notgoing I'm not going to ask you anymoreabout that uh let's go to the Daily Dotand actually just before you talk aboutit let's just take a look at thisvideo Hi aen how are you where are wecalling from today I'm doing greatthanks and I'm in London I've beenlooking forward to discussing thisopportunity with you today great stuffif if it's okay with you I'd like todive straight into it can you tell meabout a product that you've launchedthat be proud of and why certainly oneof the products I'm most proud of is amobile app that we designed tostreamline online shopping for customersit integrated Aid driven recommendationsand a highly intuitiveUI so that's a man on his laptop with aan AI version ofhimself doing a interview that's goingto be us we're going to be replaced inthe future um that's incredible yeah theapp claims 80% of people who use the appare hired um it's really interestinglots of people use chat GPT to helpwrite their resumés and cover letterssome would say that's reasonably smartabout 11% are denied the job when theemployer finds out they're using it Ithink in some ways look Louis it canlevel the playing field for people whomay um struggle with writingapplications I mean the cloning of theinterview I've got a real problem withthat because you can misrepresent the AIclone could misre represent yourcapabilities your personality your sortof Behavioral skill set lots ofcompanies have cultural interviews we doto ensure that culturally you fitwhereas if it's a clone you know you'renot going to get that from the person soyou can see all sorts of problems withthat but but I thought that was greatthat you had the the video there becausethat's where this is potentially goingamazing and a a familiar theme coming upnext AI replaces mamamia musical star uhfor a BBC production what's going onhere yeah look I'm really glad actuallyyou added a piece to what was in thisstory where the BB C have have have saidin a statement that they're actuallytrying to replace a voice actually thatno longer exists and I think thatcontext is really important but in thestory it's really talking about thesignificant threat to employment in thissector for example voiceovers now sagaftera had a bit of an update a few daysago um so they negotiated and ratifiedactually the the agreement when it comesto voiceover actors and with voiceoveractors they've included for example ifyou're going to say um that uh that thevoice you know that it's a a voice actorit has to be a human being people willbe remunerated if they're the voice overand it's translated into a different Anginto a different language and thearticle points to actually in the UKmaybe we should be copy copying ourfriends overseas and there ought to besome sort of Union agreement potentiallyum for artists um to protect thembecause clearly it lowers cost ofproduction there's less recordingrequired so there are going to beproduction companies in the future thataren't in this context using using AI toreplace a voice that no longer existsbut it's just going to do it becauseit's simply cheaper fascinating rightsomething uh a bit lighter to finishbeer this is in the telegraph beer madeby artificial intelligence tastes betterthan a normal pint study suggests yeahso they've taken over five years experttaste panel so imagine the data now thisis the important thing expert tastepanel so data 50 uh criteria by 15experts tasting about 250 bid and you'vegot 180,000 reviews so you can imagineall this dat these data sets right andwhat they've donear is then they'velooked at lab analyses of the chemicalcomposition of the beers and they the AIsaid essentially just suggestsalterations or amendments to make thebeer tastier and they've actuallymanaged to do that I'm wondering whereour drink is now producer I was thinkingwe would do a live tasting I somesamples so Santo to those who are goingto enjoy this new beer and you know it'sa new technology and and why not use italthough some people will always justwant that fully 100% human crafted beerno no no this is definitely AI I can geton board with definitely fan of thatright we are out of time PR Brant stuffthank you so much for that and that's itwe are out of time we'll do this againsame time next week</td>

      <td>AI And Mental Health 2023 - Computational Psychiatry</td>
      <td>it's a pleasure to introduce Fredericapetner she's now at the Carney Institutefor brain science at BrownUniversity and I have to make a littlepersonal note I got to know freder manyyears ago when she was still in ZurichinSwitzerland and at that stage I wasalready impressed by her presentation soI'm really Keen to hear what she's beendoing over the last years and the of hertalk is verystraightforward computational Psychiatryso here youare thank you verymuch can you hear me well I'm usuallytoo small for those PS but I hope that'sgood okay um so let's talk a little bitabout computational Psychiatry but umbefore I do that I want to tell you umthat I am an assistant professor at thecar Institute for brain science but Ialso have a second headon which is Ico-direct a program which is calledbrainstorm and brainstorm is reallytrying to accelerate computational brainscience or Neuroscience into real worldapplications so there can becommercialization but there can actuallyalso be building open source softwareand we fund um scientists who kind oflive at the interface between the realworld and the science so if you're veryinterested in that um come and reach outand ask more questions aboutbrainstorm okay so um let's talk alittle bit about mental health firstbecause um in this program we've heard alot about AI but I want to pointsomething out that has been reallyevolving over the last couple of yearswhich is that we have an increasingMental Health crisis just to give you anexample the numbers of depression umdiagnosis um during Co or after Co havechanged by factor of three and if we'relooking just at the demand for thehealthc care system there's a rapidincrease in demand across the board soit doesn't just mean depression there'schanges in anxiety disorderpost-traumatic stress disorder traumarelated disorder feeding sleep wakedisorders etc etc so really across theboard what we're seeing is an increasein diagnosis and increas in need anddemand um for psychiatric disorders andI think this is part of why we arehaving this meeting today is to talkabout how AI tools could actuallypotentially help us improve mentalwell-being and there is many ways inwhich they can do this and a lot of ithas already kind of reach the stage ofcompanies um so there's different waysthat I've seen this being um implementedone is optimization were you trulytrying to think about the particularpath that someone is going through andif you could actually um allow them tohave better healthare access forinstance Spring Health is a company thatwas funded by neuroscientist where theyprovide online therapy um and there'simprovements in Diagnostics there havebeen ways to kind of think aboutmonitoring and prevention so earlier onsomeone asked about addiction there wasan app I don't know if that still existsbecause the company actually plummetedbut they were trying to detect whetheryou were close to the location where youused to take in your drug and warn youfor it because the chances of drugintake in the original context is a lothigher so there are have been systemslike that that have been built and wealso heard a little bit about digitalTherapeutics earlier today um two ofthose companies on here no longer existand we can also talk about why that isbecause I don't think it's just a lackof efficiency I think it's also that thesystem has to change and adopt um fasterto it but I want to um take a moment toreally say what are the challenges rightnow and the things that we should not beoverlooking before we get overly excitedso kind of what is the butt and I wouldsay the butt in one context is that manyof the solutions that we see in AI theyactually in specifically in the contextof mental health they often a digitalversion of an existing concept um or asolution so for instance think of wootyou could basically can now use achatbot that is talking to you and itprovides cognitive behavioral therapybut that doesn't really tell us moreabout about how to treat differently orhow we could um develop new drugs thatare actually affecting mental health andum that has to do with mental health ingeneral and psychiatry in general and weneed to talk about this for a little bitso just take the example of kind of theissue with gold standards and I want totake one company um just as an example Ireally um don't know anything aboutellipses help other than the um paperthat they published but I think it's agood example of what you typically seeso here basically what they proposed isthat they take a voice sample um of anindividuals prompted so they basicallyask you how are you feeling you'regiving a response and the response couldbe around 5 minutes um alog togetherthen they use deep learning and the ideais to predict your individual depressionand anxiety score um and then that couldbasically be delivered to a care team inorder to provide action results whichbasically means putting you in touchwith um a psychiatrist orpsychologist um so they said they'reclinically validated so I looked at thepaper um and this this is something thatAldo also mentioned earlier that most ofthose papers are actually not in thebest journals um but in this particularcase what they did is they actuallylooked at those five minute voicesamples and they were trying to validateit against something else so they tookfive minutes each week over six weeksand then what they predicted is the phqsome of you might know thatquestionnaire it's the patient Healthquestionnaire um it consists in thisparticular case of eight questions umand then what they calculate issomething like an Roc curve or umbasically an IDE here to say how manytimes do you correctly detect whethersomeone has a depression as opposed towhen you're fourthly detecting that theyhave adepression so now let's think about thisfor a second to what degree is thatactually meaningful for us first of allyou would need six weeks of data um for5 minutes each with a 30 minutes alltogether from voice samples um but youcould also have gotten the exact sameresults by taking eight questions whichgoing to take you less than 5 minutesand that is not a problem technicallywith voice data CU I think there mightbe actually a lot of meaningfulinformation in voice data but we have toBenchmark it to the CL standardclassical tools that we have out thereand it's not going to inform us abouttreating a patient differently if theyhad taken that questionnaire as opposedto if they had used this for six weeksso um what I think we need to talk alittle bit about is the elephant in theroom and I think the elephant in theroom in Psychiatry is that the keyproblem is often not to get a label andor a diagnosis but the key problem isoften understand how to treatindividuals over longer periods of timeand we're not really good at treatingpatients yet with mental disorders andso what do I mean by that just take theexample of depression If you'rediagnosed with depression you typicallystart on an SSRI the chances of um as afirst responder to respond to an SSRIare somewhere depending on which studyyou look at between 30 and 45% and thenactually after 3 or 4 weeks you mightswitch to the next medication and thenagain your chances are even lower so uma lot of treatment still is um trial anderror treatment and I think that's a bigissue that is has been contributing tothe way we're treating mentaldisorders so um to get a bit of a senseof why that is I want us to look atmedicine and imagine we are living 100years um back in the day and we wake upone morning and you have yellow eyesthen back then you would go and see adoctor and the doctor would say oh youhave the yellow eye disease um becausethat's your symptom and then maybe theyfind a good name for it for instanceetaria is what it was used to be called100 years ago um and nowadays 100 yearsfast forward we know that there'sactually different reasons why you mightbe waking up with yellow eyes therecould be changes in your bloodconsolation there could be changes inthe liver it could be viral metabolicautoimmunological so there aremechanisms and causes that create thesymptom that we observing and so whatwould you do now well you would likelydo a blood test in order to figure outwhat is the most likely underlying CAand based on that test you would deliveratreatment so really we have moved awayfrom symptom based diagnosis to muchmore mechanistic and causal diagnosis Inclassical medicine and I think that'sreally been one of the progressions thatwe have seen it's not true obviously forall Fields but it's true for many fieldsso now fast forward to Psychiatry todayin Psychiatry you're not um beingdiagnosed based on a symptom but you arediagnosed Based On A syndrome so forinstance take the example ofschizophrenia SCH phrenia there'sdifferent um symptoms for instancedelusions hallucinations formal thoughtdisorder grossly disorganized or katonicbehavior if you show up with more thantwo or two or more you might bediagnosed with schizophrenia which firstof all means that two patients may notbe overlapping in a single symptom butboth be diagnosed with schizophreniacould also be that patients who fullyoverlap in their symptoms are beingtreated with the same medication butthey are not actually responding to themedication so um the way that is totypically done is the diagnosis is donebased on a book um the book is the DSMin when you're in the United States it'sthe ICD when you're are uh in Europe andum what often is missing and has beencriticized before is any mechanistic orcausal insight into what has beencausing those symptoms and so basicallywhat we are treating is syndromes butwe're not treating causes and mechanismsin psychiatry in that lack of insightthe Big Hope has been that Neurosciencecould actually contribute to that lackof insight and therefore improve the waywe're treating not just based onsymptoms but based onmechanisms okay so where are we in thisendeavor um this is a paper that cameout about 10 years ago it was written byTom Insel who used to be the formerdirector of the n imh and it basicallyasked that question why has it taken solong for biological Psychiatry todevelop clinical tests and what to doabout it well the why question is aninteresting one because um there's manyreasons why why it's been taking so longone is that um I think we have beentaking the DSM a little bit too seriousso there could be that there's actuallymultiple reasons that are causingdepression we're seeing one symptom ifyou're just focusing on the existingclassifications will actually not maketangible impacts onto saying we'retreating different subgroups withdifferentmedications um but the problem ingeneral is that it's a a large spectrumof heterogenity and something that Aldowas mentioning earlier is that mentaldisorders often um are have moridphysical disorders I'm very interestedin pain where the overlap between what'sin the body and what's in the brainactually becomes much more blurry soit's a very very complex disorder andit's a disorder often of the brain sothat's part of what has beencontributing to it is the complexity butalso the way that we've been focusing ondiagnosticcategories the question is what to doabout it too um and I I really thinkit's a worthwh paper I think there'smultiple things we can do about it and Iwant to talk about two just for now thevery first first one is to try to see ifwe can get additional disease insightsand so basically the idea is to say canwe find something about um out about theindividual that tells us a mechanisticdifference or a causal difference for amental disorder and then is this in someway meaningful because it has predictivevalidity which means I can actually saythat someone might be more likely tobenefit from one type of therapy asopposed to another one and both of thesehave their challenges so let's talkabout disease inside first how could wegain new insights into psychiatricdisorders and um if you go back to umTom Insel time at the N age one bigEndeavor has been focusing on geneticsand trying to see are there actuallygenetic variations that allow us topredict mental disorders and also theirtreatments um but it turned out it'sactually a highly complex problembecause yes there are genetic componentsboth to depression schizophrenia manyother mental disorders but it turns outthat there's usually not a singlevariation in a gene that you canpinpoint and it's also has not beeninforming us that much about treatmentsyet interesting enough funny sideanecdote after he left The N he wasactually the co-founder of anothercompany which was called mindstrongmindstrong um used the interaction within this case the smartphone as kind ofbrain computer interactions and wastrying to use sensor data like the wayyou would be typing on your phone somuch more and the type of data that Alowas talking about and used machinelearning technology to try the phenotypepeople individuals based on theirinteractions with the phone um it was aum highly promising company but actuallyalso no longer exists um again we couldtalk about why maybe lateron um then what happened afterwards welland around 2016 Joshua Gordon took overand he's the new director of the NIMHand one of the first articles that cameout back in the day was um saying thathe said we need to be um much moreserious about mathematics which seemedkind of an odd request in the context ofPsychiatry and what really what he meantis um that there should be a pushtowards a field that is calledcomputational Psychiatry and what I wantto do today is give you a bit of an ideaof what computational Psychiatry doeswhere it could be useful um but alsowhere the challenges lie so what's thebasic idea to understand this well ifyou think about the classical essaysthat I was talking about um then youwant to think about say I want tounderstand um something about a liverproblem then I need to think about thefunction of the liver part of thefunction of the liver is to actuallyclean the blood so one way topotentially test if there is a disfunction is to use a blood test so thenthe analogy would be well what are thefunctions of the brain and one of thethings that the brain does is itactually performs computation so you canthink of perception as a computation youcan think of learning as a computationso really what you want to do is if youwant to probe dysfunctions of the brainyou might want to probe those cognitiveprocesses and you could take technicallyuse computational models in order to tryto understand if there are deficits inlearning or in perception and so modelscould actually act as essays ofcomputation as much as a blood testcould act as an essay of understandingliver function so that was the originalidea um the field really was more orless started in 2012 and since then it'sbeen taking off quite rapidly and umthere's a bit of a joke that there'smore high rank review papers on it thanthere's actual data papers and I thinkum that has to do with the fact thatit's actually quite young but there is alot of excitement generally acrosscomputational cognitive Neuroscience touse these types of methods to betterunderstand brainfunction so if you look at computationalPsychiatry there is really um twosubcategories um and we already heardthis earlier today one is data drivenapproaches so you could say I'm takinglarge samples from basically brainImaging data or behavioral data and Icould try to just classify but ideallypredict for instance treatment responseto an SSRI just just based on say brainactivity data there's an alternative tothat which would be called Theory drivenTheory driven is saying oh no actuallywe are neuroscientists we understandsomething about the underlying cognitiveprocess so that could be simple modelsof cognition and computational models offor instance learning or perception butalso much more complex biophysicalmodels and you could say okay I knowsomething about dopamine functioning inthe basil ganglia and I want to use thatas a way to inform how I'm making forinstance better pred i s so um for awhile we've been treating them a littlebit in their own Pockets there's manysuggestions to marry those and that'sreally what's been happening in standardor the novel um papers that I see incomputational Psychiatry where you usefor instance these Theory drivenapproaches to do really what you cancall kind of a dimensionality reductionwhere suddenly you get meaningfulparameters that tell you something aboutcognitive function and you combine itwith for instance machine learning inorder to make better predictions orclassif ifications so really nowadays wesee both being merged but what I willtalk about for most of this lecture isabout the theory driven approaches andyou heard a lot about the data drivenapproaches already earliertoday so one question that you might beasking is okay why should I use a modelwhy don't I just take recordings ofBehavioral data or and brain Imaging whywould you actually want to usecomputational models in this particularcontext and if we take the example oflearning there's a couple of advantagesmodels have above and beyond um justpure behavioral data one is thatactually they allow you to translateboth tasks but also your assessmentsacross species which is often very hardto do so you can actually have a modelof learning from prediction errors thatboth explains the behavior in a redmodel or Mouse model but it alsoexplains it in ahuman the other one is that you actuallycan quantify behavior in a way that isum means that for instance you have aparameter estimate that tells yousomething about the speed of learning ina particular context and then thatallows you to basically reduce thedimensionality or you could even saymaybe people have different strategiesof learning and I'll give you examplefor that later on and you can comparemodels and see which best describes theactual Behavior what's the mechanismunderlying the behavior and there havebeen simulations like this one on theright hand side showing that by doingthat you can actually be much better atpredicting because you're removingliterally noise from thedata um and then I think the mostinteresting when we think about thedevelopment of new drugs is that you canactually think about biologicalimplementations and that type of insightwill basically if you have a model thatdescribes the function ofneurotransmitter systems could actuallyallow you to make predictions of whatcould be new trug treatments or new trugtargets for psychiatricdisorders and for instance one examplecould be the role of dopamine in umtemporal difference learning but there'smany others okay so um for the next uhcouple of minutes what I want to do isjust give you um um not the detailedexplanation of um kind of what themodels exactly do but an idea of how youcould approach questions usingcomputation and psychiatry in in comptwo really fundamentally different waysand the example that I want to take andboth of those cases actually OCD um somany of you have probably heard ofobsessive compulsive disorder it is adisorder where you have um a set ofsymptoms that are around eithercompulsions where you're repeatingbehaviors very often or obsessivethoughts where you have these rumthoughts here's for instance andescription of a patient who hasOCD and um they would describe it as Ihave to check the computer a milliontimes to make sure I haven't leftanything open on it sometimes I write itdown on a piece of paper nothing onscreen at 523 for example which helps Ihave to pick up the phone and check tomake sure it's hung up which doesn'talways help because then I think I hungit up wrong when I checked so I justunplug it so this kind of gives you abit of an sense of this these repetitivebehaviors and um a lot of and people useOCD now very colloquially but patientswho are suffering from that they oftensuffer from that for many many hours aday it's a highly disabling disorder umand we need to understand better what ishappening there interesting enough whenyou look at the history of um signsaround OCD there have been differentphases with different proposals ofwhat's happening during OCD a very earlyone proposal was that maybe it's memorydeficits you do something and you forgotthat you actually executed it andbecause you forgot you have to do itagain or you have to check againanother um much more prominent theory iscome from a work Consortium that wasmore driven by clinicians where the ideais it's actually an disorder ofdysfunctional beliefs so here thequestion was for instance if youoverestimate the threat of not doingsomething in particular um then thatmight lead you to repeat your behaviormore and more often so we've allexperienced that part of it and during aphase of for instance the co epidemicwhere suddenly everybody would washtheir hands a lot more often becausethere was a high high cost to pay if youdidn't and so that could be one of thedrivers of repetitive Behavior the senseof responsibility and also anintolerance to uncertainty so reallywanting to be sure that something wasdoneright um that wasn't a verycomputational Theory though so it's veryhard to teste with computational modelsbut there came a phase where people talkmore and about computational models forOCD and that came from the field ofhabit formation and animal work actuallywe're saying you also see repetitivebehaviors in animals and there it'soften different it's not really goaldirected and that you have a goal thatyou want to achieve with your action butyou're habitual and you basically becomeoverly habitual so you're just repeatingactions without actually thinking aboutthem and so maybe it's a form of veryexcessive habitformation another way to explain thisthough is to say well you can be stillvery goal directed you can actually sayI want to achieve something but I have ahard time understanding that the worldof the state of the world has changed sofor instance if I clean my hands I stilldon't believe that they actually gotcleaned due to the action so I'mrepeating the action again which is adifferent way of thinking about itbecause one is way more go directed theother one is more habitual and so whenyou wanted to test something like thatand and try to understand what themechanisms are then um for this lastpart we were thinking about particularways of actually trying to get insightsinto that and why um I got veryinterested in understanding State andstructure learning is because it hasbeen actually heavily associated withthe orbital frontal cortex which is alsothe main region M regions where you seeoperations and OCDand it turns out that um it is can beparticularly modulated by ssris orserotonin specifically in the ofc andseratonin turns also uh to be the go-todrug treatment for OCD so there may bean interesting link to how the drugmight be functioning in the way we'relearning about the environment that youcould explore by understanding therelationship between OCD and structurallearning so how could you approachsomething like that if that's yourhypothesis or the thing you want to testwell one way to approach the this andthis is standard I would say see whatyou see in terms of computation ofPsychiatry and cognitive modeling is youcome up with an experiment that isactually testing that in an individualum you're acquiring data and then youhave different models that are trying toum describe the specific underlyingBehavior then you compare those modelsand either you try to find which is thebest model explaining the data um and umeither there's one model that isexplaining the data particularly welland you try to relate that to symptomseverity so that could be some parameterestim you're extracting from the modelor on the other hand you say there'sactually different learning strategiesand I find that different models are umthere's different subgroups that usedifferent strategies in a particularparall so in this case what we did is wedid something quite um related to thatwe basically used a paradigm where wehad people learn structure in this caseum it was shells so you could decide tocrack those shells open they had Seasonssometimes they're in a particularly goodseason sometimes they're in a Bad seasonso it's a bit like you know I'm livingin New England now I didn't use used toeat oysters but I feel like I'm obligednow that I move to this place and so youhave seasons where you particularly wantto collect your oysters in others whereyou really don't want to do that and sohere the idea is that for every singleshell people had to basically learn whenit is in a good phase or when it's in abad phase and then basically collect inthis particular moment in time we hadtwo groups we gave some people aopowhich is an Sor it's just a single doseand the other group basically justreceived a placebo because we wanted tosee the influence of of drugs onlearning and then what you do is youacquire data you see that peopleactually have a good way of learning theparticular task you're tested on umagain I don't want to go into detail butthen you can come up with a set ofmodels in this case we actually usedvery different um sets of models a awhole bunch of models that basicallysaid you um you're not learning anystructure but you're repeating what usedto be good and you stopped doing whatused to be bad so that's a stimulusresponse learning model that's much morehabitual as opposed to some someone whosays no actually I learned somethingabout the season of the shell and basedon which season I think that shell is inI'm going to pick it or not so I learnedstructure and these are nested models inthis case we're using reinforcementlearning and this was actually banObserver model um and basically you cannow say okay which are of these 16models best explains the observedbehavior and there's many many differentways of doing this now um to basicallydo um model comparison in this case weused a method called basion modelcomparison we inferred the parameters ofthe model using mcmc that's basically away just to simulate um and Bas what yousee end up seeing is there's oneparticular model that explains the dataa lot better than all of the othermodels then you also want to definewhether that's actually just a bad modelout of many bad models or if it's reallycan capture the structure you see in thebehavior next um but the interestingthing in this case was and it couldexplain our behavioral effects but nowhow does what you're getting out of themodel actually relate to OSsymptomatology for instance so in thisparticular case you take a winning modeland you relate it to how obsessivecompulsive are individuals and you seethat the more you have a tendency tolearn structure the less OCD traits andwe observed and then the other questionthat you wanted to have is how does itrelate to drug plasma levels of an SSRIand the higher the drug plasma level wasthe better they were actually atstructureal Learning in this particularParadigm so that kind of fitted intothis general idea okay there is arelationship between this the umrepetitive behaviors that you see herein structure learning and it can bemodulated bydrugs um I just wanted to give you thisnot as an a solution to what SSRI do doin ofcd I think there's way way way moreto it but I wanted to give it to you asan idea to understand how some of theseclassical paradigms and computationPsychiatry looklike but one of the problems with thatis often that we tend to then sit in oneNiche and explain one problem but we'renot explaining everything that has beenout there and we are not even relatingdifferent theories in this particularcase of OCD to one another so just usingthis basically tells us yeah maybe theyare learning deficits but how does itrelate to the fact that for a long timepeople have observed these dysfunctionalbeliefs they couldn't relate it tobehavior so isn't there a way toactually try to start to combinetheories usingmodels and so one that I wasparticularly interested in is trying tounderstand how we can actually describebeliefs and beliefs are a hard onebecause when you think about how would Istudy beliefs in humans then one way Icould do this is I could get groups ofhumans in change a specific belief whichis actually already hard to do um andthen I would have to do that for everysingle belief and see how it is actuallychanging behavior and that's a tricky umexperiment to do in general thealternative could be to say okay can wejust take a very simple scenario andsimulate how agents would act underdifferent beliefs so basically what wedid here is we said let let's take themost simple symptom-provoking scenariowe could think of describe it with amodel that explains what might be goingon in this particular scenario and thensimulate agents that act under differentbeliefs about the environment and seewhich of those agents would actuallystart to um display symptomaticbehaviors in which ones won't and againyou have to Define this all of this verywell and then you could get subsets ofindividuals um and understand how theydiffer in their specific beliefs so youcould get a sense of which beliefs arecausal and which beliefs are justconsequences of um certain behaviorsso to give you the analogy again theexample that um I like to use in OCD isthat we were really interested in tryingto understand how these fears of harmingothers the worries about contaminationsactually could be described so we cameup with a very simple model in this casethis is a partially observable Mark ofdecision process where you say yourhands can be in two states they caneither be dirty or they can be clean youcan interact with the world like cookingthere's a certain probability that yourhands will get dirty after you cook andthere's a certain probability that whenthey are dirty you're actually poisoningyour friends for instance while cookingso there is a punishment associated withthe state and you could also mean youknow basically this is like theclassical Co example that we talkedabout earlier if you wash your handsthere's a certain probability when theyare dirty that they become clean againbut there's also a chance that theyactually stay dirty and then there's alast way you can actually just try toget evidence from the environment byobserving it but the action itselfchecking doesn't really change anythingabout the state of the world itself sothat was the simple model that we cameup with and where we have a lot ofparameters in here that you couldactually be mapping onto beliefs so thenext thing we did is we actuallysimulated 10 thousands of agents and wesaid they all act interact with the sameenvironments but they have differentbeliefs so some believe that the cost ofsickness is extremely high so it'sreally the punishment that I'm receivingwhen my hands are dirty is very highothers would for instance think thatit's very likely that your hands getdirty so whenever you touch somethingthere's a high probability it willactually turn into dirty hands or youcould have an example where basicallythey distrust their successful avoidanceaction so they distrust that they canclean their hands well and that might beadriver so now you can simulate thebehavior of those agents and see wellwho is actually showing repetitiveBehavior so it's repetitions of checkingand washing as opposed to those thatdon't develop that behavior and then seehow are they different in theirdifferent beliefs here is the quickanswer because I don't want to go toomuch into detail in this turns out thatboth of those groups those thatdisplayed comp C of behaviors and thosethat don't didn't actually have a fairlyveridical representation of all of thoseparameters in the world they don'tnecessarily overestimate a threatthey're different in one particularaspect only which is that theyunderestimate the efficacy to avoid umthe punishment in this case theyunderestimate their efficacy in washingtheir hands so they didn't trust thatwhen they wash their hands they actuallyturn out to be clean and that isinteresting because it maps ontosomething that has been observed in OCDfor a long time that differentiates fromgeneral anxiety disorder in generalanxiety I might be very worried aboutthe state of the world but I'm notnecessarily acting in OCD often timesyou're acting to avoid a negativeoutcome so there's a relationshipbetween your own responsibility and thebad outcome out there in the world ifyou don't trust yourself in being ableto avoid that that might actually be adriver of repetitive behavior and that'sinteresting because now if you thinkabout therapies one thing that is donein OCD is exposure therapy where you'rereally trying to face those behaviors inum execute actions you would otherwiseavoid so I wanted to to basically justtake these two examples as two differentways in which people have been trying tokind of get disease insights usingcomputational models um in this contextof computational Psychiatry if you fadedout because you're like I'm notinterested in models of OCD now is agood time to fade back in because now Iwant to talk about something differentwhich is how you can actually if youhave new disease insights how do youreally test whether they are um um validand what I mean by valid is that giventhat we don't fully trust the diagnosticcategories we have right now thevalidity of a model should not just betested by can I determine if someone hasa depression or not but can I actuallysay something meaningful that isclinically relevant for that individualand something that is clinicallyrelevant for an individual is forinstance saying I can predict whetherthey're going to respond to treatmentaob or I can predict that someone is atrisk of relapse and that suddenly makesit a prediction problem you want to saysomething about an individual in afuture State and that's a really goodway of trying to validate models but italso means that you need a differenttype of data because most of the timewhen we're thinking of data we don'tthink of data that are we basicallythink of this classical idea of big datathat I'm going to show you in a littlebit but here I want to have data pointsof an individual and how they evolvingover time because that's really going tobe clinically relevant data so um whenwe're thinking of big data we typicallysay we just need massive data ofdifferent individuals and we want toclassify but in this case what I thinkthe kind of data that are going to bereally relevant in the context ofPsychiatry where our diagnosis don'tperfectly lead to the right treatment isum what I would call deep and wide dataso deep data means that you have moredata points of the individual over thecourse of time that you can saysomething meaningful about theirprediction in the future and white dataobviously means that you at largersample sizes across the population thatis explaining that and that'sinteresting enough some of the hardestdata to get in science and the reasonfor that is that most of our fundingschemes actually provide grants thatlast up to three years and by that timeyou ideally have finished your study andpublished your paper but when you'rethinking about longitudinal data thatoften means I have to follow up peopleover months and sometimes over years wejust had one study where we looked atpathologic and gambling and we finishedthe data acquisition 8 years years lateryou can only do that if you're notrelying on Grant schemes that basicallylast three years and I think part of theproblem we have right now is that inscience we have to make a bigger effortto get this type of data but also whenwe looking outside science that dataexists but it's actually oftenproprietary so companies own that typeof data of you if you logged intoFacebook a couple of years ago theydefinitely have a lot of thoselongitudinal data points on you but it'susually not the data points that we canuse to gain new ins Ides on mentalhealth so um I was a bit frustrated withthat and I was quite lucky when I cameto Brown that I proposed to think aboutways in which we could actually acquirelongitudinal data um and I got corefunding from brown to build a tool inthis particular case we built an app andthe app was focusing on pain becausethat was my new research interest sowhat we've been building for two yearsnow with a set of software Engineersdesigners scientists is basically aplatform where individuals can tracktheir own pain over over time so theycan enter um that they've been receivinga treatment so we released it actuallylast April since then we have 1,500downloads if you want to download it youcan do that on the left um it measuresthings like your current pain intensityinterference and pleasantness where inthe pain people experiencing a bodywhere they experience pain their moodtheir emotions which medications theytook which treatments they took on theparticular day and which activities theyengaged in we asked about expectationsand all sorts of other things and webasically turned it into a tool that notjust we can use it because it was a lotof money and effort that went into thisbut actually can be freely used byscientists all across the world so nowif you wanted to run a study you canactually um the participant can log andsay I'm part of study xyc you see therein study specific inform formed consentand then the data will be acquired for aspecifical research study so you can usein clinical trials or in your ownresearch if you're interested in thatjust reach out to me and we can discussit um so why do we decide to do thistype of data in pain where we askingabout someone about how much in pain doyou have how much do you bother well thethe reason is that pain is somethingthat you cannot assess with passive datayet I talked to a former head of Applehealth and then he told me we always Shiaway from pain for a very particularreason neither your heart rate nor yourmovements nor anything predicts how muchyou are in pain or not the only reliablereport that we still have a subjectivereport for pain which means you needexperience sample for many many otherthings I think that's no longer true weactually can leverage passive data fromyour smartphones or from the environmentwith pain that's an interesting onebecause we still rely on the subjectiveexperience of the individual sufferingthat's why we chose to have self-reportas the keymeasure okay so what are the kinds ofquestions that you can try to answer nowthat I think are interesting well one isthe example of chronic pain so most ofyou sit in this room and you're sittingin a chair pretty pretty much all daylong so um there is a fair chance thatsome of you have back pain and um that'sactually quite common amongst us that weknow many of us will end up having backpain if you had an acute injury or youjust had a surgery um then usually youshould have an acute phase of pain whereit really warns you of repeating thebehavior that has been hurtful not tostep on the foot that was injured butthis shouldn't last too too much toolong so for instance after 3 to 6 monthsmost of the healing processes in thebody arecompleted the bad news is that more than20% of Americans nowadays actually havepain that persists much longer than thatperiod and that's referred to as chronicpain and if you're unlucky and you'vedeveloped chronic pain you're actuallyset up to a really War long and windyroad through the Healthcare System whereoriginally you might be treated withacute pain meds there was a time whereyou actually received opioids thisdecreasing luckily in the United Statesand actually opioids turn out to be nota good treatment for chronic pain um youmight receive physical therapy or muchmore invasive treatments like epiduralinjections or radio frequency ablationif it's back pain and again there's abad news here because despite the factthat the treatments are really invasiveonly 50% of those um treatments actuallyprovide long-term pain belief when otherwords to say 50% of these reallyinvasive treatments actually F fail toprovide provide pain relief um to theindividuals and the big question for along time was why is that the case andthere is multiple explanatory frameworks but I think specifically in painresearch the notion has becoming that wehave been focusing a lot on theperiphery we have been focusing a lot onnose deception the signal that is kindof entering the brain from the body andtells you about tissue damage but thereis multiple factors that actuallycontribute to pain that might bebasically predicting whether pain ismaintained and that could be at thelevel of the brain some of theindication comes from the fact that ifwe are in this room more than I guessmost of us above 30 so um if you're 30years old there's a 50% chance that youhave a dis degeneration in your back andyou're asymptomatic which means you'renot reporting anypain and um if you getting into kind ofyour 80s then you're at 96% but not 96%of people in the 80s actually reportchronic back pain so the truth is thatthere may be degenerations in your bodythat you easily adjust to but they don'tnecessarily explain why you experiencingpain on the other hand when you look atthe brain during an acute pain phase asopposed to chronic pain they actuallyseem to be rep representing completelydifferent pain Network so acute painoften activates the saliency networkbasically drawing attention to the thingthat's currently bothering you whilechronic pain actually seems to activatedifferent brain circuits particularlythe misic system or Pathways where umthe idea has been that it it'spotentially associated with learning andmaybe chronic pain is a form of alearned response and a learned Ranceresponse so really could be Mainmaintained not just by peripheralfactors but by Central factors that umare at the level of thebrain and so um this is somewhatsupported because we now know thatexpectations fear context your socialcontext actually are stronglyinfluencing the decree to what you'reexperiencing pain um despite the tissuedamage that you have in the body soabove and beyond that there's a lot ofcentral factors that influence your ownum subjective report of pain okay let'sgo back to why that is a veryinteresting um problem the problem thatwe really want to address in pain isfirst of all you want to say who is atrisk of developing chronic pain after acertain period of time because then Icould prevent and that's something thatAldo mentioned earlier ideally we wantto focus on prevention not justtreatment and the other one is to saycan we predict who is going to benefitfrom treating specifically because radiofrequency ration for instance costseveral um um thousand dollars toreceive every time you get it you'reallowed to repeat it up to eight timesso there's High Health costs associatedwith these treatments we want to know ifthey'reeffective so um basically what we'redoing right now is we run clinicaltrials where we try to ask thesequestions we take computational markerstargets that basically explain howyou're learning um together withmeasurements of kind of brain activityto do basically um studies where we bothpredict the response to peripheraltreatments in back pain patients umafter they've received radio frequencytemplation and we're looking at acutepain patients and see if we can predictwhether they transition and to do thatwe really monitor how they're evolvingover time and so now you might be askingwhy on Earth would you need an app toactually get these continuous data youcould just ask them again after fourmonths and you'd be done and youwouldn't have to acquire continuous databut there's another problem with painand that's why I wanted to use thisexample where pain reports are actuallyhighly variable and only when we look atindividuals over longer periods of timewe really understand what is going on onso like let's take this example um wheretypically when you want to assess ifsomeone is improving after an injury ora surgery you would um ask them how howbad is your pain right now and theywould say at six that's actually fairlyhigh on the 10 point scale these are twoparticipants that took part in our studyand then you ask them again 3 monthslater you say okay how are you feelingnow one might say actually I'm feelingworse I have more pain and the otherperson might say I'm feeling better andif there's more of a three-pointdecrease then you would actually saythat's a sign ofrecovery problem is if you had askedthis patient one day earlier that wouldhave been their pain report if you hadasked this patient one day later thatwould have been their pain report sopain is extremely variable and singleratings often really fail to give you afull picture of recovery and so when youlook at the continuous data that weacquired over four months you see thatone person actually recovered and therewere early signs of recovery in thefirst two to three weeks and then if youlook at the other patient he actuallyhas chronic pain and High variability intheir pain reports and now the nextanswer could be well that the problem isthat people are just noisy in the waythey're reporting pain um but it turnsout there's a lot of meaningfulinformation in this variation so what wedo not now is with these large data setsthat we have that are longitudinal as weactually say how different factors areaffecting this variability in pain thatwe see and just this is just to give youan example we ask them about theiremotions and basically we see that everysingle positive emotion is leading iscorrelated with a higher or like a lowerpain score on that particular day andevery negative emotion is correlatedwith an like a higher pain score on thatday so emotions contribute massively tothe variability that we see around painand that is likely very meaningful umvariability because as we said theseemotional states actually influence thesubjective experience of pain itself andso then the question is well is thismeaningful to say something about peoplethat kind of four months from now can Isay much more about prediction byunderstanding how um there's differencesin recovery and so basically we comparedreports um with a few four monthsdifference and wanted to see what isreally predictive of whether you will beum um improving after four months of ifyou will be doing worse and it turns outone of the questions we asked them iswell what do you expect to feel like infourmonths um and the answer is that thatparticular question was the bestpredictor of whether they would bebetter or not above and beyond the merefact of their Baseline pain so it'stheir expectation beyond the fact thatthey have you know obviously a baselinepain score if you're correcting for thatalso above and beyond the way you'reassessing it Etc so really yourexpectations four months from now aredeterminated whether you will beimproving or not we have another studywhere we did the same thing aroundtreatments and we can show that theperipheral treatments the best predictorof whether you're going to benefit froman injection into your back um iswhether you expect to be benefiting fromfrom it prior to the actual treatmentthat's again with a two we difference inthis particular case and now thequestion is well is this meaningful Iwould say yes because you can now thinkabout belief interventions they'rechanging and working onexpectations and that's part of what wehave been um developing now over the thepast couple of weeks is to think aboutcan we actually change beliefs aroundspecific conditions in order to improveit and that kind of moves more into thisspace of digital Therapeutics that weheard aboutearlier to wrap this up um I think whatI wanted to highlight is that I think inPsychiatry have we have a slightlydifferent problem than we have inclassical medicine which is that the waywe've been diagnosing people has beenheavily relying on symptoms andsyndromes and if we just try to make newtreatments or predictors in this spacewe obviously fail to explain a lot ofthe mechanistic differences that weactually might be observing inpsychiatric disorders and we should moveaway from trying to treat syndroms totrying to treat mechanisms and causesand that's a way where computationalPsychiatry could really help gain thoseinsights into mechanisms and causes theother part that I wanted to point outthough is that if you really want to nowvalidate those new models that might bemechanistic or causal they still stilllive in the space of the DSM so if youwant to show that they have validityinstead of just saying they allow you tocategorize or label individuals youshould try to answer meaningfulquestions and these are meaningfulquestions about how their diseasesevolve over time so really computationalassets the idea behind this is to usethose models of disease mechanisms applythem to brain activity Behavior orindividual patients um in order todetect those subgroups of Dimensionsthat are different based on theirmechanism and then allow individualtreatment prediction and development andI really think this this later partrequires a whole different type of datawhich is longitudinal data that areoften hard to get in science and I thinkwe should make active efforts to reallytry to get and develop those types ofdata sets and share them openly in thecommunity and with that I want to thankmy amazing team um and my collaboratorsat Brown University and if you'reinterested in this project you candownload it and contact me thank[Applause]you wowfantastic I am already looking forwardto the next round when you have solvedall these problems um let's get over andsee um what ouraudience there's there's another onehere s onhere should beonsoB well um very interesting talk um oneone thing that um really struck metoward toward the end is um therelationship with with predictive brainhypothesis kind of ideas about uh aboutthe role of expectation in in thingslike uh chronic pain um you know thereare these anecdotes of things like youknow construction worker gets a spikethrough the boot you know is an extremepain you know needs to get treated forit and so and then it's discovered thatthe the spike didn't actually Pierce atoe at all and of course the moment herealizes this then the pain goes away uhyou know but in general uh this problemof of um people's uh illness uh you knowyou're you're dealing with a system thatis learning and in which the role ofexpectation feeds back on what on Whathappens and and I would imagine this isquite General it's not just about painso do do you worry about sort of pittingtwo predictive systems against eachother which in effect is what you'redoing with with with all of yourmodeling that you're you're sort ofchasing something that is running awayfrom you does does the question makesense yes um and I think it has twoparts the first one is uh related to umhow much do the symptoms of your observehave to do with predictions that we'remaking and I think you're quite rightspecifically in the context of pain Ithink what the brain has to solve is aninference problem where it gets sensoryinputs and it has to figure out is thisa threat to my physiological Integrityyes or no so if I'm stepping ontosomething I'm actually hurt I shouldstop working on that because I cancreate further tissue damage and that'sexactly what I want to avoid and thatwhat acute painserves if I infer that there is a damagelike the example of the constructionworker I should also stop walking and Ihave that experience of pain unless Irealize there was actually no threat andso um pain has a lot to do with threatsand fears around injury um so theexperience of pain can be both driven bythe actual input from the periphery butit can also be driven by Central factorsand um I actually worry less about thatwe can not um kind of address that withcomputational models but rather I thinkthat um um it we we really need highquality scientific data showing theseeffects because the way we're treatingpain at the moment is not acknowledgingthat aspect at all we're basicallytreating the periphery and that acrossthe board and it's also for patientsextremely hard to acknowledge they maybe Central factors because it and theyfeel stigmatized which I think iscompletely wrong because there is abiological underpinning the origins isjust elsewhere and if you really wantedto treat it you would have to treat itelsewhere so these insights are actuallygoing to shift the way that we'retreating like symptoms that both arisein the body and in the brain again ofgets back to what Alo was saying earlierthat we have to think of us as anembodied system that has not just abrain but also physiology um to kind ofgive you a bit of a sense of how youcould actually get at some of this so wereally interested in um this aspect ofrelief so if if relief is actuallysomething that is extremely meaningfulto chronic pain patients because it's away to avoid pain and you can studyrelief using cognitive models and we'redoing and we're actually seeing um quitesubstantial differences between chronicpain patients and healthy individualsand by tapping into that Learning Systemyou understand okay that actually has todo with dopamine dopamine is not thetypical Target um when you're thinkingabout pain so maybe this will lead us tothinking about new treatment courses aswell okay audience first yeah pleasethank you um I'm curious about the Somaapp and whether you are connecting it toother data sources to track some ofthose longitudinal outcomes and andbasically just how interconnected Somais with other data types yeah it's areally good question we just wrote agrant if we get it the answer is it'sgoing to be veryinterconnected um if not it's going totake a little longer so um one of the soone of the things that I mentionedearlier is that everybody's getting veryexcited about passive data and and metoo but as I mentioned for pain they'renot ideal because they really don't tellyou that much but you want to know ifphysiological metrics of recovery areassociated at all with physiologicallike psychological metrics of discrecovery so um this is that's why I'mtesting this ring here by the way it'sthe aura ring they have been developinga ring that you can wear that trackssleep that tracks um heart rate ittracks temperatureand the idea is to integrate their datathat they get from the passive um devicewith our data that tell us somethingabout actual experiences so that's thefirst integration we also thought aboutthe integration with electronic healthrecords um and that one is a bit of aharder um step and the reason is that wetook a lot of care regarding dataprivacy we basically know nothing aboutthe users and we don't want to um so theonly thing that they were interest inemail address and the only reason thathas to be entered is to recover yourpassword there's no names there's nolocation data nothing and I think it's abig problem with the data that we'reacing right now is privacy um andelectronic health records are a wholedifferent story then you would knoweverything about people so you have tofind a way to completely separate itfrom the Ty data that we have and umwe've been very careful to not get intoa space where information ispersonalizedyetStephanie is there anything from ouronline audience yes um is computationthe easiest function to measure um wrtbrain function and what about emotionsorry can you repeat the last uh is isum is computation the easiest functionto measure wrt uh brain function andwhat aboutemotion I'm not 100% sure if I fullyunderstand the question but I like ifnot they can repeat it I think the thefirst question is is computation thebest way to measure the brain uh orbrain function and I think um part ofthe function of the brain is computationI would basically rephrase it I think alot of the things that we do arebasically computational processes thatum our networks are carrying out andtherefore trying to reverse engineersome of this is actually quite usefuland we've seen various different ways oftrying to get at um that for instanceyou know in dance talk earlier where webasically looked he looked at the visualsystem I think that's a completely newway of trying to understand thearchitecture of the visual system usingthese models and so they can allow us togain both insights into biologicalsystems and potentially vice versa umregarding emotions I think emotions arevery interesting because the reason Istarted to study body brain interactionsI I'm a percept like I used to docomputation models of lower levelperception space and time perception andthen I moved into computation Psychiatryand that was what got me reallyinterested in studying the body becauseemotions arise because there are signalsfrom the physiology of your body thathelp you you know they basically arepart of the emotional experience and ifwe ignore the fact that we have a bodywe'll have a hard time explainingemotional processes so that's why Istarted to study Inception simp exactlyfor the reason that I think we haveexcluded bodily signals for a long timein our models and there is new attemptsto kind of have comp ational models ofinceptive processes um that try toinclude this more it gets more and morecomplex and harder to do but I thinkthat is a way to try to get new insightsinto emotions using computation as wellyeah okay great um the another questionis uh can the AI llm detect thesecomputations that are otherwise notperceptible to ushumans the AI LM yes says can the AILMmuchlearning yeah yeah yeah I'm just uhwondering if that was referred to anyparticular slide that I had oh I don'tknow which slide it was um but we canmove on to the next question um it sayswhat do you think the role ofpsychiatrist with the tools thatcomputational Psychiatry will provide ohI see that's an very interestingquestion because I don't think the pointis to replace psychiatrists at all Ithink that's a wrongmisconception um intalk we've seen one version where thatcould take where it's basically a way toAid Psychiatry andpsychiatrists um to provide better carepotentially I think where um where thiscould really start to play an animportant role is um developing newtargets for treatment and so optimizingtreatments around um sub mechanisms thatcan be both cognitive therapies actuallyum so for instance with cognitivebehavioral therapy it's quiteinteresting we have a set of kind of amore or less a manual not everybodysticks to it um or but we don't reallyknow what the active ingredient is wedon't really know what the the change isthat is being induced you can actuallystart to measure that that's part ofwhat we're really interested in istrying to understand what are thecomponents of therapy that work for anindividual and potentially make it morepersonalized and then combine itobviously with classical clle I thinkthere's no way and also this should notbe the goal to replace classicalpsychiatry but to Aid it great thank youum there is one last question here howaccurate is the aura ring uh last Ichecked not so much for tracking sleepunless you're pairing it with AItechnology yeah so when I talked to themum what I wanted to have is a way to soI study something which is called aheartbeat ofok potential it means howyou're processing every single heartbeatin the brain and I wanted to use thering to trigger every single heartbeatcan't do that it takes averages but umthere is a paper out there that actuallyCompares this to other devices andthey're all fairly okay for certainmarket like heart rate on average that'stotally fine if you want to do fancystuff that I wanted to do with it um noteverything is um working but yeah it'snot an EKG if you wanted have an EKG umthere is I think the Apple watch allowsit but then you need a closed loop soyou have to put a finger on it um to getactual EKG data from those devicesnowadays but it'spossible okay uh thank you those are thequestions fromfrom the virtual apartment thanksStephanie yeah so I think we have to saythank you for era[Applause]again</td>

      <td>RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATING NEW WAYS TO DETECT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THROUGH A.I. POWERED APPS. DATA IS BEING COLLECTED A BEHAVIOR THAT COULD DETERMINE SHIFTS IN MOOD TO NEW WAYS. JOINING US NOW AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE AND PSYCHIATRY AT DARTMOUTH, AND AT THE AIM MENTAL HEALTH LAB. YOU COCREATED A -- AN APP CALLED MOOD CATCHER. -- CAPTURE. TALK ME OFF THE LEDGE. I MIGHT BE SCARED. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT HE DOES. PICK UP YOUR PHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; OKAY. LET ME BACK UP AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GOALS. WE USE A.I. AND DATA CAPTURE FOR SMART PHONES AND WEARABLE SENSORS TO PREDICT THE SEVERITY AND COURSE OF MENTAL HEALTH. A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY DEVELOP THINGS LIKE MOOD CAPTURE AND MOOD TRIGGERS, WHICH IS ANOTHER APPLICATION DEVELOPED AT DARTMOUTH, TRYING TO ENSURE WE ARE ESSENTIALLY INTERVENING IN THE MOMENTS OF GREATEST NEED AND TIMES THAT ARE TIMELY AND REALLY DELIVERING THE PRECISE MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS THAT FOLKS MIGHT BENEFIT FROM. WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP THIS ALLIANCE -- THE SCIENCE AROUND THAT. THEY OPERATE IN THE BACKGROUND. THE DATA WE GATHER ARE THINGS LIKE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, HEART RATE, BREATHING RATES, SLEEP PATTERNS, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. AND REALLY, EVEN THINGS THAT, YOU ARE MENTIONING INTERACTION WITH PHONES. IN TERMS OF HOW THIS DATA CAN BE USED, I THINK IT IS REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS A NUMBER OF STUDIES NOW, THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PREDICT MENTAL HEALTH QUITE WELL THROUGH ALL OF THIS REALLY INTENSIVE DATA, AND REALLY THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO JUST MONITOR FOLKS CONTINUOUSLY IN A BIG BROTHER WAY, IT IS TO TRY TO ACTUALLY PUT POWER BACK INTO THEIR HANDS. WE ARE USING DATA FROM THEIR DAILY LIVES THAT INFORMS THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. &gt;&gt; I AM A GIRL AND LOVES ANYTHING THAT COLLECTS DATA ABOUT MYSELF. THAT MAY BE ANOTHER MENTAL HEALTH -- ONE OF THE GADGETS I WEAR ALL THE TIME KEEPS TRACK OF MY TEMPERATURE AND MY SLEEP AND MY MOVEMENT AND THIS AND THAT. I FOUND IT INTERESTING WHEN I GOT COVID THAT ASKED ME A FEW DAYS IN IF I WAS SICK OR IF SOMETHING ELSE WAS GOING ON BECAUSE IT DETECTED MY LACK OF MOVEMENT AND TEMPERATURE CHANGE. I THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD EASILY BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH DATA. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS RIGHT. ONE OF THE THINGS, IF YOU WERE TO ENTER A HOSPITAL AND YOU TALKED TO FOLKS DEPRESSED, ONE OF THE STRIKING THINGS IS HOW SLOW THEY OFTEN PRESENT BUT THEY ACTUALLY MOVE MORE SLOWLY THAN MOST OF US. WHEN WE ARE ACTIONS -- ANXIOUS, YOU OFTEN GET RESTLESS. THOSE THINGS CAN ALSO BE GATHERED THROUGH SMALL MOVEMENT HAPPENING THROUGH THESE DEVICES THAT ARE PHYSICALLY ATTACHED TO AS. -- US. YOUR INTUITION ABOUT HOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND MENTAL HEALTH CAN BE IN MUCH MORE INTRICATE WAYS THROUGH THESE TYPES OF DATA CAPTURE. WHEN WE HAVE THESE TYPES OF MODELS THAT A.I. CAN PROVIDE. IF YOU GIVE US MORE INDICATORS OF WHERE MENTAL HEALTH IS REALLY SHIFTING AND MORE WAYS. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ASK YOU TO SUM UP IN JUST A MINUTE, ASIDE FOR MY FEAR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR SOMEBODY USING THIS INFORMATION FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES, CAN YOU ENVISION A WORLD WHERE A.I. BECOMES YOUR PSYCHIATRIST? IN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE NOT ONLY LEARNING THE DEVICE MAY LEARN YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, BUT CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE OUTLET FOR WHICH YOU WOULD GET BETTER? &gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK THE FUTURE IS NOW. WE'RE DOING THAT TYPE OF WORK AND TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY GIVE FOLKS ACCESS TO ALWAYS ON CARE THROUGH THIS A.I. I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CARE SYSTEM WHERE YOU INTERACT WITH SOMEBODY ONCE A WEEK, MAYBE. IT IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND CAN PROVIDE GOLD STANDARD CARE. SO I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR THIS KIND OF WORK TO BE DEVELOPED, BUT IT IS VERY PROMISING IN TERMS OF INCREASING ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY AND EMPIRICALLY SOUND CARE. &gt;&gt; HAVING A POCKET PSYCHIATRIST WHENEVER YOU NEED ADVICE AND GUIDANCE, RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE YOU WOULD BE BOTHERING THAT THING WAY TOO MUCH.

      <td>Review of Mentalyc: AI Progress note generator</td>
      <td>mallic is the very first AI progressnote generator I had ever seen write aprogress note and it really blew my mindhi I'm Dr Melissa mcaffrey founder ofthe free Private Practice paperworkcrash course and today I'm going to giveyou my full review of using mallic towrite progress notes full disclaimer Iam not affiliated with mallic in anywaythis isn't an ad and I've chosen not toget any compensation for any of these AIplatform reviewsthis is my own review from myperspective and I recommend you use itas just one piece of information to makeyour decision about whether or not touse metallic this might be a littleconfusing if you have actually seen mypicture on the metallic website andwhile they did provide me with a freeaccount to test metallic out I am not anadviser for the company nor have I everbeen and I am not accepting anyaffiliate payments and have not done sookay now that we have all that legalstuff out of the way and hopefully havecleared up any confusion let's dig intothe criteria we're using to review allof these AI platforms we are going tolook at number one how does it actuallywork number two what is the pricingthree how will it potentially integratewith your EHR or current record systemfour what are my favorite features fiveany cautions or concerns and six howwell did it actually write a progressnote so let's dig in first how does itwork well you can actually use metallica few different ways you can upload anaudio file which is a recording of yoursession and that's what I did for theprogress notes that I wrote usingmetallic you can also type in a fulltranscript or just a summary if you feelcomfortable just typing in a few itemsand you want it to create the note foryou that way or you can log into theirplatform and actually conduct yoursession online through metallic and itwill listen in and record the sessionand then create the note afterwards nowobviously uploading just an audio fileif you needed to record on your phone orsomething or logging into their platformand just using it as your online teleHealth platform those are both reallyeasy options however with the textversion you are limited to between 100and a th000 words and of course thenyou're writing yourself which youprobably could have just written theprogress note in your electronic healthrecord in just as quick a time so howmuch does it cost well the leastexpensive plan is actually $39.99 amonth and in that plan you get up to 100progress notes each month and you canrecord sessions for up to 75 minutes thenext plan is $69.99 a month and you getup to 160 progress notes you also getadditional templates including templatesfor couples groups kids and you cancreate custom templates which aren'ttechnically custom in my mind but itmeans that you can customize the optionsalready available within mallic and inthat plan you can record up to 130minutes in one session there's also anadditional Pro Plan that is forprescribers who see a lot more clientsmore frequently but um for much lesstime how does all of this integrate withyour current recordkeeping system oryour electronic health record well itdoesn't so you need to copy paste um itis pretty easy to do so there's just anice button you can click copy paste andthen paste it into either your EHR orwhatever other document system you havefor keeping records you can alsodownload a progress note if you want tokeep notes on your computer or need tosave them for some other reason you canalso download a progress note if that'san easier option for you so what aresome of my favorite features well thefirst one is that they have really takena lot of feedback to try and improve thesystem so when I first saw mallic usedit was actually I think almost two yearsago now and they have made a lot ofimprovements since then based onfeedback from people who are using itthey've added customization featuresthey've added things to emphasize usinginsurance and make sure that each Notecovers medical necessity criteria andthey continue to try and improve the AIitself so that it writes better notesanother thing I like is that it's areally easy system to use right awayit's very simple there's not a ton ofthings that will be confusing when youlog in you'll know exactly where to goand what to do I also like that theygive you flexibility for creating acustom template how this works is thatthey actually have a variety ofdifferent templates available thingslike dap and soap kids notes couplesnotes Etc each of those note templateshas different sections so there aredifferent bullet points within a sectionfor example in the data section theremight be things about symptoms or whathappened in the session or a variety ofother things most of those sections havea little check box when you go into tocreate a custom template and so you caneither check off if you want it or don'twant it in your custom progress note sowhile you can't like upload whateverprogress note you're currently using youcan at least pick and choose withintheir options and one thing that seemsunique to mallic at least at that atthis point is that a lot of thoseoptions are really specific to thingslike Psychiatry or EMDR or eveninsurance so whatever you need to havein your progress notes for your practiceit probably has some options availablefor you another thing I like is that youcan choose both what you want to becalled in the progress note and thenwhat you want the client to be called Ialways default a client and that's justa personal preference thing but you canalso choose things like individual orpatient another cool feature is thatthey have a really detailed intakeprogress note so this progress noteactually covers all of the sections youwould need to review in an intake and isreally more like an intake assessmentnow I always recommend that you haveclients fill that information out yousend them a form ahead of time they fillit out ahead of time and that way youcan just focus on the aspects withinthat assessment that are really key tocover with them but if you like to dothe form in session with clients or if aclient for got to fill out the form thenthis would be a great option for makingsure you cover all the aspects you wantin that intake session just know thatthe metallic intake progress note doesnot have all the things that arerequired to have in an intake progressnote it's really more of an intakeclinical assessment another nice featureis that they make it really easy todownload their baa business associateagreement which if you're in the US youneed to have you need to have downloadedum for in order for you to be hip acompliant they also have a clientconsent form so it's a great example ofa form you can use to give to clients togive them a heads up that you plan touse AI during a session or even if youdon't use the recording feature if youplan to use AI after to write yourprogress notes and as an aside here atleast at this point in 20124 it would beunethical to choose not to see clientsbecause they don't want to consent foryou to use AI for their progress notesbut for clients who are totally okaywith it um it's a great form to have anda way to prompt you to review with themlastly I like that they give you lots ofoptions of what to do with the noteafterwards so you can copy paste you candownload you can also download atranscript of the session which again Icould see being really useful maybe ifyou're in a training situation or forcertain sessions so that's a benefit ofhaving a system that actually recordsyour session and then produces thistranscript for you okay so what are mycautions and concerns and then we'll getinto how well it wrote the progress noteso while I think it's fabulous that theycreated an impairments and challengessection to meet that medical necessityrequirement that so many clinicians needforinsurance I do feel that it tends toover pathologize the client in thesession so the language and the way thatit describes what happened in thesesections um tends to be more on thesevere end and order to meet thatinsurance criteria also if you areworking with insurance just because anyof these AI platform progress notes giveyou symptoms give you a diagnosis orlist things out you also need to makesure that actually matches whatever isin your intake assessment diagnosis forthe client and also um and the currentdiagnosis and then what's in thetreatment plan because I could see thatit would be really easy to start relyingon the progress node generator to giveyou this information but but then ifit's changing the diagnosis every coupleof sessions because content is changingthat could be really problematic anotherconcern I have is that mallic didactually create information that did notoccur in the session now it did this afew months ago when I had tested it outat that time and although they've madesome changes since then and that sameinformation wasn't made up this time newinformation was made up the bottom lineis AI is probably not ever going towrite a perfect note for you and youalways have to review it to make surethe content is accurate okay so let'sdig into the specifics how well didmallic write a progress note well it dida great job of summarizing the session Ifeel like mallic does an excellent jobof giving a really good summary andpicking out what is important from thesession without making an extremely longand difficult to read note it also givesyou client quotes and some really gooddetails but again without making itsuper long that said the defaulttemplates are kind of like templates onsteroids so they are still really longfor example in the DAP progress noteit's not just data assessment and planthere are like 10 bullet pointsunderneath each of those sections so ifyou use the custom note feature you cango in and uncheck a lot of those thingsthat are really unnecessary I thought itwas really cool that the note includednot just the interventions but alsoidentified the therapeutic approach andI had not given any information aboutthat so it extrapolated that from thedata now as a side note the therapeuticapproach was person centered therapy andthis was the session with Carl Rogersand most of his interventions that werevery accurately listed by mental umwouldn't pass an insurance audit sodon't use that progress note as anexample for what you should use forinsurance but mallic did do a reallygood job of summarizing theinterventions that he was providing inthe session now let's get into into whatI was talking about with it kind of overpathologizing some of the thingspresented in the session so in thissession Gloria the client is talkingabout a time when she lied to herdaughter and she was feeling kind ofguilty about it and deciding whether ornot she should tell her daughter thatshe lied to her and how that mightimpact their relationship but the notereally presented this as parentingissues and kept alluding to the factthat she was struggling with parentingand I felt like that could be a reallynegative thing for someone to have intheir therapy progress note when itwasn't that she was you know doinganything really harmful or that this wasa negative thing it was more an internalconflict and even in the process of thesession they dig into that aspect alittle bit more and it becomes aboutother things I also felt like this waspotentially a one-off example somethingthat may have never happened beforemight not happen again and yet itpresented the information as if theseparenting struggles were an ongoingissue for this client specifically thenote actually said that her currentstruggles were affecting her ability toparent effectively and that's one ofthose things I could see potentiallybeing harmful to someone number onebecause I don't feel like that actuallyaccurately reflects what was occurringin the session or the issue that she wasdiscussing and number two I just thinkthat's probably a very bad thing for atherapist to write in a progress noteunless there are is a much more extremeexample so as a therapist I think it'sabsolutely fine to say that someone wasdiscussing parenting or is strugglingwith parenting issues um but I would notassign a value to that unless you had avery clear example of something that waspotentially abusive and you needed tothen make a child abuse report now othersessions that occur this type of thingmay not show up in mallic but it did inthis one so I like that it isemphasizing really specific things andInsurance wants to see in progress notesbut I think it might be overpathologizing a bit because of that nowif you want to see these notes and checkthem out for yourself you can click thelink that will be in the descriptionbelow and I will send you a copy of theprogress notes that metallic wrote aboutGloria session with Carl Rogers and thatwill also include my own personal notesabout little specific things within theprogress notes and make sure you'resubscribed to this channel so you'll getnotifications every time we have one ofthese new AI platform reviews come outhappywriting</td>

      <td>AI And Mental Health 2023 - A Fruitful Reciprocity: The Neuroscience-AI Connection</td>
      <td>our next speaker is DanYamin and um Dan is at Psychology andcomputer science at um StanfordUniversity and I just found out thathe's also at the Wai NeuroscienceInstitute and um Dan is talking todayabout a fruitfulreciprocity the Neuroscience AIconnection so Dan it's all yours thankyou so much as Peter mentioned I'm goingto be talking about a the reciprocitybetween neuroscience and Ai and in ourgroup we work on sort of three basicareas one is cognitive science that isessentially in our case something likebenchmarking humans and machines atscale okay we also look at Neurosciencetopics that's essentially makingpredictive models of brain and data ofbrain data um and um the glue here isreally artificial intelligence so that'sbasically building neural networks tosolve cognitive tasks and then use thoseum toate hypotheses both for thecognitive data and for the Neurosciencedata internally to the models right sothere's really these steps essentiallythinking of cognitive science as Targetsetting for AI and then AI as hypothesisgeneration for thinking about the brainokay I'm going to mostly be talkingabout AI helping Neuroscience today sothe direction of using AI models to makemodels in Neuroscience although it cango in the other direction as well okayso one of the problems that we work onthat's sort of most um uh visuallyobvious and also at the base of a lot ofour work is visual object recognition sothat's basically knowing what is whereby looking okay and even if you haven'tseen this particular scene in CambridgeMass before you know that what you'relooking at are these different types ofobjects and it's quite robust andeffortless for you in domain Generalokay um some of you may know but I'llgive you a little bit of background thatum this type of ability is supported byWhat's called the ventral corticalpathway of um brains and you knowprimate and uh nonhuman you know humansand non-human pade brains and in thevental pathway there are a series ofbrain areas starting from kind of theretina and then going up through earlyvisual cortex that's like V1 and V2those are ventral 1 and ventral 2through intermediate visual cortexventral four and then up through highervisual cortex that's also known asinferior temporal cortex and thosedifferent parts of that um the keythought is understanding though is thatif you ask humans or non-human premiseto perform recognition tasks likeknowing like what object is in an imageum data for being able to solve that ispresent in the higher visual cortex soessentially if you look at um neuralresponses in V4 you get some performanceon a recognition task but if you thenlook at it Downstream in higher visualcortex um the um performance issignificantly higher okay um at thelevel near or near the level of humanperformance itself behaviorally so it'slike saying these neurons areresponsible for that type of behaviorokay um so that meant and this has beena long ongoing project in various waysis that our goal is to buildquantitative models in that system okayand starting more than 10 years ago nowwe've been using um neural networkmodels to do that an earlier class ofmodels that is still quite powerful thispurpose is convolutional neural networksokay so these are basically networksthat um were designed originally tocondense the rough neuro anatomy of theventral pathway in that they arehierarchical meaning they come in aseries of layers or sections like I justshowed you and they are retinotopicessentially that is to say spatiallytiled orconvolutional okay um individual partsof those layers the internal structureum is made up of nurly plausible basicoperations like linear filteringcombined with some nonlinear structureslike thresholding pooling normalizationum Each of which could in princip L beimplemented by one or few synapses okayum and you can think of these operationsas having kind of Neuroscience uh umversions and data science or uh you knowU machine learning meaning um I won'tget into the details of all of thosetoday but that's like kind ofsummarizing 50 years of research in inin the field um but the idea is is thatthose operations are applied convolutionessentially the same at all locationsdragged around the image and by virtueof doing that um if the image is aninput if you have image like input thenyou end up with image like output withlike one sub one kind of filter um oneslice for each filter okay so this ishow a convolutional network works ingeneral and then it's stackedhierarchically to produce deeper andmore complex operations okay so that's ahierarchical convolutional neuralnetwork now in principle that makes alot of sense for thinking about thevisual System since it's sort of basedon similar PR um you know principles atleast uh at a high level but of coursethe there's a huge number of parametersthat are consistent with this conceptmeaning like both architecturally likehow many layers how many filters Etc umtogether with more like fine graincontinuous parameters like the filterparameters right and so a big questionis how you would discover the rightparameters to understand real cortexokay there's many ways to do this um butone way that we have found over time tobe most effective is basically what wecall Gold driven modeling that is to sayoptimizing the network for performanceon real world tasks likecategorization and then looking at theinternals to see if they match data sothis is not direct optimization towarddata it's optimizing for a task that youthink the brain system performs and thenyou can see how well that constrains theinternals right now actually doing theoptimization as a bunch of work rightand it's been a bunch of work over yearsas we get better and better models wehave to work hard to actually solve theoptimization tasks but assuming you cando that what you end up with is perhigher performing models such as thatred bar here that performs reasonablywell on the task and then you can askhow well does it describe neurons and akey early result was that there's astrong correlation between these thingsin other words across thousands ofmodels that's what each of the dots areperformance on a task x-axis highlycorrelates with ability of the existingthe model with that performance level topredict neural responses internally okayso that's like saying that you can getpretty good models by optimizing for atask pretty good models of the brainsystem that solved that task right sincethat early work deeper models have beenable to go beyond that and in particularpick apart very fine grain differencesbetween areas such as um sort of modelsthat have uh uh early layers that looklike V1 early visual cortex internalintermediate layers that look like V4cortex and then higher layers thatseparately um parcel out different partsof higher visual cortex like posteriorand Central and anterior it inferiortemporal cortex right and the key thinghere is it's the same amount sorry it'sthe same model that accounts for all theareas right you don't need a differentmodel for different areas it's the samemodel with sort of anatomicalconsistency meaning the proper area ofthe model describes the the acorresponding area of the brain okay umand there sort of at a very high levelwhat I'm describing for you here is akind of um class complimentcomplimentarity I guess you could saywhere there's a classical approach inneuro in neurophysiology um of goingkind of bottom up like looking at thefeatures or look at what's computed inthe neurons and early layers and goingup up the system to try to construct anidea of what's happening in higher areaswhat I've been telling you here is thata top down kind of endend goal-basedapproach using neural networks does agood job meaning you impose a task onthe system and that constrains what thesystem is like internally in a powerfuland meaningful way okay and of course umsince early work there's been a lot ofum further types of models that peoplehave developed like with any thing whereyou can assign a score you can getmodels better and the Brain scoreproject has been quite helpful atorganizing all of that work and ummotivating people to produce better andbetter models of the whole system okayum but it actually goes beyond justVision so here's another related slidethat comes from thinking about theauditory system okay so here it'sdifferent classes of models withsomewhat different architectures solvinga different task but nonetheless if yousolve the task better and better that'sthe xaxis here you get substantiallybetter at having internals of the modellook like the data okay and thecorrelation seem quite High here butwe've never been able to break them okayso we think that there is somethingstrong about that actual meaning in thatsystem and in particular uh althoughthese are different classes of models umsolving different tasks it's a similarprinciple a high variation taskperformance drives models that look likethe internals in the brain okay and thisactual approach has as I say um beenapplied to primate and human Visionthat's been applied to human auditionbut actually it's also been morerecently applied to things like animalcognition so animal vision as well asmemory and Mouse um meteor entor rhinaland hipocampal system um as well as inthe work of many others in the motorsystem in olfaction and actuallyrecently in human language essentiallyyou optimize word models and you showthat the internals of those languagemodels are do a pretty good job ofdescribing neural responses in the humanlanguage system okay um and you can askwhat kind of understanding these thisapproach um is right um you know a sortof classical form of computationalNeuroscience um works with sort of alittle bit cleaner ideas so you knowsome kind of closed form formula withprovably optimal theoretical propertiesand the descript use for example oftrying to describe neurons in earlycortical areas like V1 with Gaborwavelet um uh um filter Banks okay sowhat I'm telling you here is not thatokay it's not that clean okay but it'salso not the same as just a purelyempirical approach where you would saytake a neural network and just fit it tothe data in an online way right end toend way right it's not that eitherbecause instead what's happened is isthat we've optimized networks to solvetasks and then found that those arehighly constraining okay so it reallylike plays on the notion that nothing inbiology makes sense except in light ofevolution or the neuro version of thatwhich is nothing in Neuroscience makessense except in light of behavior and sowe can translate that in our words intothinking that nothing in Neurosciencereally makes sense except in light ofoptimization okay or maybe we should saycomputational Neuroscience but um thatthe underlying theme or in other wordsbehavior is highly constraining of thebrain for animals at their scale and forhumans on non-human primates at theirscale okay bigger mechanisms but highlyconstrained by the harder tasks thatthey do right so underlying optimizationmodels are these kind of four basicingredients one is the architectureclass so that's like the circuitneuroanatomy okay two is the objectivefunction or you can think of that insort of biology terms as the ecologicalniche three is the environment or thedata set that it's trained on and fouris natural the learning rules so thenatural selection and synapticplasticity right in biology terms rightand what I'm basically telling you isthat say as of something like 2016 okaythe best proxies for the ventral pathwayfor using this idea to construct a modelof the ventral pathway the visual systemum was to take the architecture class tobe convolutional networks of reasonabledepth to take the task to be multi-wayobject categorization to take the dataset to be like imag net images okay andto take the learning rule to be kind ofevolutionary architecture search plusfilter learning through gradient descentokay um and that's a nicestory but actually it has someingredients to it that are sort of whilepowerful kind of from a predictive senseobviously wrong okay so one is that thearchitecture class has no recurrence infeedback and no topographical structureboth of which are key features of theactual brain okay um the task orobjective right required like lots of oflabeled data and we know organismsaren't getting that um more data setslike imet are like these likestereotyped clean still images ratherthan real noisy video that actualorganisms get um and then of coursethere's all sorts of problems with usingback propagation and neuroscientistswill tell you how non neural it is umthat's a long story um but each of thesethings is like okay it's a problem butit's also an opportunity for likefiguring out what to do next okay and soa lot of the work that we've beenthinking about in the brain area hasbeen um like dominated by working towardthose fixing those problems so I'm goingto tell you a little bit about each ofthese um in the remaining time that Ihave okay the progress that's been madeum so let's start with the first onewhich is recurrence as an architecturalissue right if you look at an actualbrain what you see is that there's lotsof local recurrence and there's alsolots of longrange connections feedbackConnections in the brain to and frobrain areas rightum thinking about that in context umwe've made models that combineconvolutional structure with recurrenceokay do work of M um due to my formergraduate student iron Nabi who's now umuh doing his postet MIT um and basicallywhat that means is a convolutionalneural network that also has localrecurrent operations that's like theGreen Arrow and long range feedbacksthose are like the Red Arrows okaythat's a it's a recurrent neural networkbut it's one that's essentially a got alike a backbone of uh a forward sweeplike the kinds of the models that havebeen previously shown to describeventral pathway reasonably well okay sowhat's the computational idea here theidea is that you can do better withouthaving to be very deeper so if you takea convolutional forward like a forwardum feed forward model of a given depthit does so well um on a task like imagnet performance if you double thenetwork depth of course it's much biggerin terms of number of units it can getbetter at that task okay we don't thinkthat's how the brain does it it's likeyou don't get a lot better at a task bylike doubling the size of your head casethere's got to be some better thing okayso um that's the notion of whererecurrence comes in now some of you maybe familiar with standard recurrentcells such as long short-term memorycells lstms or others turns out thatthose are not particularly effective inthe context of a convolutional structurehowever with the right structure and umyou know the details of which I couldtalk about if people are interested butum let me just say are inspired bystructures that are observed in thebrain um you can actually um with anetwork that's equally deep to the blackbar produce performance that's about asgood as the network that's twice as deepwithout having to double the number ofunits just a very small number of unitsand mostly just back connections andrecurrences okay um so with thatoptimized structure where you have somelocal recurrent network of a given formand some longrange feedbacks you canimprove performance but can you alsoimprove your ability to predict neuralDynamics that's the questionokay so one way to evaluate this is tocompare what people call Easy versuschallenge images so easy images are oneswhere neural networks that are feedforward do well and challenges areimages are ones where they don't butwhere animals or humans still get itright okay and an interestingobservation is that in the animal datathis is a non-human primates um if youlook to decode the uh the the um imagecontents um The Challenge images takethat animal longer so like 20 or 30milliseconds longer to Solokay so meaning presumably someadditional processing is occurringperhaps current processing okay so howwould you show that okay how would youum infer that that's actually what'shappening one way to do that is tonotice okay each image gets solved at adifferent time by the animal and you canlook at the object solution time uh umvalue for each image image by image inthe animal and you can also use aconvolutional recurrent neural networkto make predictions about objectsolution time because that Network willhave times when it solves each image aswell and you can ask are the animalsneural solution times similar to thesolution time pattern of theconvolutional recurrent neural networkand it turns out that um this is a keyresult here is that um Dynamics fitthat's on the the y- axis is optimizedby those convolutional recurrent neuralnetworks okay um if you look on thex-axis that's percentage of challengeimag is solved deep neural network feedforward networks with hundreds of layerscan also solve those images but theydon't fit the pattern of when they'resolved nearly as well as theconvolutional recurrent Network okay sothis suggests that the recurrent Networkthis convolution urrent network um areum matching the key sort of neurodynamicproperties of the brain in a useful wayokay and if you think about this from apoint of view of why is this the caseand look at model performance versusmodel physical size deep feed forwardnetworks are very big and solve lots oftasks shallow feed forward models arenot so good but shallo is or brain rereasonable depth convolutional recurrentnetworks um achieve a good trade-offbetween performance and size so they'rekind of right at this par optimalbetween being not too big but solving atask so that really indicates thatrecurrence is there to make the braincase a reasonable size it's reallybasically a biophysical principle okayum so you know thinking about thatdoesn't mean we've come anywhere closeto like actually completely nailing thequestion of what recurrence is doing andhow it should be involved in thesenetworks um that would be good we arenot there we're more like in the okayishstate of having models that are umharder to reject completely reject outof hand okay um better than we werebefore being obviously deeply wrong okayso that's where I kind of I think we arefrom the architectural point of view interms of recurrence and feedback um withthat in mind let me move to talkingabout what I think is one of the biggestissues that sort of plagued me when Istarted my lab a few years ago and wassomething which I wanted to makeprogress on and lo and behold due toboth our work and also kind of theamazing work in the community in AI hugeprogress has been made there okay andthat is in the issue of supervision soum there's just no way that organismslike this receive millions of high levelsemantic labels during training likeokay humans probably don't and Macertainly don't okay um supervisionmight be an effective proxy and might bewhat's optimized Over The evolutionarytime scale but there that's clearly notwhat's happening in terms of the actualmechanics of learning okay real visualexperience is more like this likebasically babies or toddlers see stuffand they get some hear some audio andstuff perhaps and then they even if theydon't hear audio for one reason oranother they still learn how to seepretty well um and so um that'sformalized by this very beautiful dataset that was collected by among othersmy colleague Mike Frank at Stanford thisis the seam data set this is a data setof a head-mounted basically they puthead-mounted cameras um on um on a fewseveral toddlers well infants and theytrack them from uh 6 months of age to 32months of age with as I say thishead-mounted camera it had mono audioand visual channels in it and theyrecorded a couple hours a week right solike the big challenge is like how wouldyou use a data set like this to learnwhere you don't have labels it's notwell for formulated it's like video dataEtc right so obviously at some level youneed some kind of unsupervised learningto do this okay but the question is whatEXokay um and like um unsupervisedlearning with neural networks or othershas a long history um but basically fora long time it kind of just didn't workthat well okay that was basically thestate of affairs up until like 2018 2019right so um thinking about anautoencoder again um uh we saw an autoencoder in the last talk here's an autoencoder formulation of an unsupervisedlearning problem which is essentially uhimage comes in X the network is supposedto reconstruct um the image X hat and istrying to minimize the differencebetween those two that's the first partof L function but of course to make thata non-trivial problem you have to havesome kind of bottleneck or penalty inthe middle okay in this case um a veryclassic form of this was the sparse Autoencoder that was um shown in the mid90sby work of Runo olous and others to do areally good job of um describing V1neurons so basically if you have asparse activation penalty on the hiddenlayer of a shallow neural network andyou optimize it to do Recon structionand natural images the filters that comeout look a bit like Gabor wavelet filterBanks which in turn look a bit like V1neurons okay um so that's like sayingneurons have to represent theirenvironment efficiently right um ideaslike that were sort of limited thoughand if you try to apply them to bundeeper networks in a naive way itdoesn't actually produce betterrepresentations right so that kind ofthis field was kind of stuck there for awhile um since then um another idea hadcome up which is sort of missing dataproblems like you give me something yougive me the full image I or the datawhatever it is take away some portion ofit and then use what's remaining toforce the network to predict what wastaken away and you hope that therepresentation that is learned to dothat learns something meaningful okay soone of the neat versions of this iscolorful image colorization this isbasically where the auto encoder isinstead of trying to reconstruct theoriginal image you take the originalcolor image grayscale it push thatgrayscale image through the network andthen Force the Network to be learnedparameters that will colorize the imageright so now that's no longer in dangerof triviality because um you're not justtrying to reconstruct the original imageokay and the concept is that perhaps youneed to learn something about objects toknow how color should be distributed inthe image and it turns out that that dida pretty a better job okay stuff likethat missing data problems were betterthan Standard Auto encodersum but anyway neither none of thosemethods were really all that powerfuland so um though uh starting in like2018 2019 a new um form of methods cameout that really started to change thingsand that's called Deep contrast ofembedding okay so I'll give you anexample of an early form of contrastiveembedding um developed by Stella woo andsome of her colleagues at Berkeley andum this was the instance recognitionproblem so basically uh here you have anetwork actually without an encodersorry without a decoder there's nothere's no Auto encoder here it's just adeep Network like of a standard kind umthat produces an embedding and thatembedding and now in in of beingoptimized to solve categorization isoptimized to put different versions ofthe same image push them close togetherin embedding space while pushing apartimages that are not that image okay it'sreally simple I have the same image Imight make General versions of it bycropping it in different ways it's as ifyou move your head okay and then youpush together the embeddings of thosewhile just pushing apart anything elseyou see and it turns out that that ledto quite an improvement in terms of theinternal representation learned abilityto solve other tasks and it sort ofdeveloped started to kick off a wholenew field among which my student formerPhD student Chu contributed verysignificantly to and in particular hehas a whole series of papers developingboth contrastive learning methods andalso applying those to thinking aboutthe brain right and in his method calledlocal aggregation what he did was notonly try to push together the same imagebut also figure out in a kind ofunsupervised way what other images arelikely to be similar while things thatare probablydifferent push those apart bydistinguishing close versus backgroundneighbors okay I won't get into thedetails of the math about how that thatuh contrastive optimization is done butnonetheless the point this is that ifyou start out before training in a kindof randomized way when you end up withis the development of kind of um uhmultiscale clusters at various umwithout having to have any initiallabels for them okay and this was areally nice point because actually thisnetwork was the first um unsupervisedNetwork to do better than superviseddeep Nets that had originally kicked offthe deep learning revolution in 2012 sothat's an arbitrary point of uh likereference but it just was to say that umthese unsupervised networks were able tomake substantial progress on the problemand push you know they're sort of cominginto their own as actual solutions tothe problem right and not only do theydo solutions to categorization tasksreasonably well they also solve lots ofother tasks okay which is what you'dexpect since they're not optimized forany one particular Cask they're sort oftask agnostic and then you hope that therepresentations generalize and indeedthey generalize reasonably well to avariety of types of tasks like objectposition estimation object sizeestimation and so forth okay um for usthough the key question was how well dothey predict neural data right if youtake the neuron the neural networks inthis kind of unsupervised way comparethem back um to real neurons whathappens right basically using a similarprocedure to the one I uh hinted atbefore that had been been used to thinkabout the the uh supervis networks rightum and this sort of t- to force paperthat tungu had um he showed a lot ofcomparisons of this form and reallyestablished unsupervised models as thebest existing model of the ventalpathway so in particular what he foundwas that contrastive embedding models umfinally were at a position where theycould um be about as good if notslightly exceed supervised models at umpredicting neural responses in the inthe brain systems okay um and this wasreally kind of the time that there was aquantitatively accurate unsupervisedmodel of a higher brain area um and notonly um was this something that was truefor one particular brain area but againthere's this kind of anatomical mappingconsistency where early layers of themodel were best at describing V1 orearly visual cortex intermediate layerswere best at describing intermediatevisual areas like V4 and higher layerswere best at describing higher brainareas such asit um of course that's all on staticimages but one of the original thingsthat I said we needed to be able to dois work on video and uh tungu um wasable to develop methods that took theNotions in images and bring them intothe video context where now there'sstatic processing stream that's astandard kind of 2D Network as well asDynamic processing stream that's a kindof um spacio temporal filtering okay andyou can train that Network to solve anunsupervised video embedding tasksimilar in nature to the ones used forimages and it turns out that that worksfrom a computer science point of view sothat's like a computer Vision um advancebut the real thing from the point ofview of our ourum investigation today is to think abouthow you would use that to apply back tothe type of data that I mentionedearlier the head-mounted cam data rightand where it looks basically like thisright um and so this is a really hardproblem because real kids data doesn'thave the kind of ability to be bufferedthe way that um you know big data setsdo computer vision databases do theyhave many fewer distinct examples rightyou don't see a thousand different cupsor a million different cups you see afew but you see them from a wide varietyof viewpoints okay but in any caseregardless of the difficulty of theproblem the key point is that with anunsupervised video processor you canstick the video of that kind into theactual neural network okay um and itturns out that if you do that using thesort of contrastive um video methodsdeveloped by tungu then um you get endup with networks that have learned topredict neurons as well if not slightlybetter than things trained on imag netokay so it's like you can actually usereal world data from the organism totrain the network okay and that is ahuge difference from say earlier visuallike unsupervised video processingmethods such as like you may have heardof predictive coding simple inversionsof or or um you know uh versions ofpredictive coding implemented do quite abit worse on this suggesting that youknow you really need to do somethingmore like contrastive learning to beable to get networks that per performwell um and learn Vis you knowbrain-like representations from RealWorld data stimuli um and you know inLong Run what we'd love to do is makereal models of visual development rightyou know obviously the data for that ishard to come by um but that is somethingwe work on with our collaborators so youknow um the takeaway so far right fromwhat I've said is roughly that thecontrast of unsupervised approaches sortof finally made up that supervision Gapum and they work pretty well in realdata streams okay um so looking back atour report card here um we've looked atsort of gone from like bad to like okayon a few different things so havingrecurrence and feedback not needinglabeled data um being able to handlereal world noisy video data streams okayum I'm not going to say too much aboutthe the back propop question I'll comeback to that in a minute but umobviously it's still imperfect so if youlook at this the dotted line is wherethe noise ceiling of the data is so whatthis is saying is is that the selfnetworks are like not solving itcompletely right that would be somethingthat we really still have to solve umbut what's particularly interesting tome and I was sort of chagrined aboutthis when I F when I sort of realizedwhat this meant was that I kind ofexpected okay if you can really dobetter with unsupervised approaches youought to be able to do better thansupervised ones at describing neuralresponses significantly but actuallywhat you see here at least on thismetric okay is about as good but it'snot better it's not like the likesomething that's more natural and it'slearning process is like that muchbetter at describing the neurons rightso that was something that um sort of uhmade me think okay um and so now I'mgoing to tell you another story that isRel ends up being highly related to thisone it didn't obviously start that waybut it will end up there okay so I'mgoing to take most of the remaining timeto focus on that okay so okay so youmight think what do we know this issomething we thought about some time agowhat do we actually know about thevisual brain okay on the one hand weknow about neural response propertiesthat's like neurons and how they respondto stimuli okay everything I've talkedabout so far is kind of in thatcategory we also about neuralarrangements okay like literally neuronsare on so the surface of the brain thecortex is on the surface of the brainright and like the neurons are arrangedon that surface in like a verystereotypical physical pattern okay youcan think of that as sort of topographyor functionalorganization okay um and in the visualsystem there's lots of verycharacteristic functional organizationor functional topography okay one forexample is that an early visual cortexum what you have are maps um in variousdi different dimensions so if you lookat humans non-human primates a few otherspecies what you see is thesecharacteristic pin wheel representationswhen you tag neurons for theorientations that they like V1 neuronsand early visual Cort like different umbars basically different orientationsdifferent edges of different different Dangles and if you tag them for theirtheir preference what you see is thiskind of interesting pattern where thereare these large ISO ISO orientationdomains spatially with like U um sort ofinterspersed with um singularities in soso-called pin Wheels okay that's whatthose colors are and if you look atthings other than frequency um than spalum orientation preference you can alsothink about like spatial frequency orcolor responsiveness you get maps ofvarious kinds okay so these are spatialmaps that are present functionalorganization that are present in earlyvisual cortex in higher visual cortexthere's a very different or at leastapparently very different form ofspatial organization so in this caseit's like um patches of neurons thatseem to respond to categories of variouskinds so like faces or places or bodiesor you know um organized according tothings like like an axis of animacy orother things that people have describedreal world object size okay so thisorganization of the higher of highervisual cortex according to varioustopographic structures okay apparentlyquite different from those that arepresent in earlier visual cortex rightand these these observations are likeamong the most robust things about thatare known in Neuroscience right so ourhypothesis um sounds like it's totallyunrelated to unsupervised learningthat's going to come back is thatregardless of how you solve this problemum there is an underlying combination ofsolving the a task and optimizing somekind of biophysical constraint and thatthat should explain all of thetopographical data okay so just to makethat more concrete from a neuralNetwork's point of view imagine you havea neural network solving a task with itsloss fun part of its loss function andthe other thing that it's doing with itsloss function is minimizing some kind ofum biophysical or spatial cost I'm sorrythat's cut off at the bottom but itshould says um L total loss on thesystem is the categorization loss plusAlpha time the spatial loss okay soAlpha is like a weight that says howimportant the one component of the lossfunction is relative to the other thebiophysical cost versus the task costokay um and so the question was couldyou generate patterns of all differentkinds with the same model in this way ina unified fashion right to do thatthough you have to actually addsomething to convolutional neuralnetworks or neural networks in generalwhich is that although there's sort ofspatial um retinotopy um the channelDimension the like the dimension of thedifferent filters in the network or thedifferent neurons at a given spatiallocation are not laid out in any spatialway right con Nets or other deep Netsdon't have any claim on that okay so tomake it connect to the problem you haveto lay them out so basically um puttingthe neurons in an actual physicalsurface in this case it's a 2d squarebut that's sort of like meant to be likea tissue model a spatial model on thesurface of the cortex okay and you cando this for every area um and this iswhat it's like how people see you seethe sort of ropic fields Fields laid outspatially separately okay so this is tomodel that idea okay and then on thosefields you can apply spatial loss withperformance uh at at the um optimized atthe end right and so the question is ifyou do this what happens um so umnetworks of this kind I'm going to callthem topographical deep artificialneural networks and you can ask do theypredict the Topography of the realsystem and the basic straightforwardanswerers they do very well so in V1when you want to observe um orientationMaps what you do is you probe the systemwith drifting gradings bars of differentorientations basically and then youmeasure orientation tuning and make amap of the preference so um it's quitehard to know whether this comes fromdata or an actual model this turns outto be a model that's at the 1 cmet scaleis that box um you know you have to picka and fix a size scale for the units tobe able to make a codir comparison um ifyou blow up to the 1 mm scale what yousee is that the networks are not totallyordered but they have exactly thestructure that you might expect from thenot totally totally ordered data in thereal system um and you can see that bothfor orientation tuning as well asspatial frequency Maps color preferenceMaps that's a cytochrom oxidase stainthat basically says whether the cell isresponsive to a certain kind of color umregime uh so um this isqualitative you can also quantify thisyou know it takes we could spend a longtime discussing exactly what the propermetric for matching neural network mapsto data maps are um but um suffice it tosay that we believe that we've done thatreasonably um and when you do that youfind that the sort of orientation tuningspatial frequency and color maps ofthese topographical deep networks do avery good job of describing the actualdata in MAAC okay so they're prettysmooth they've got pin Wheels butthey're not as smooth as they could beand actually some earlier models um likemade things that were very smooth andactually much too smooth to actuallydescribe the true data as well as thesebetter more recent deep neural networktopographical models so something aboutthe data is like a little bit dirtierthan you might think from a very simpleclean um uh perspective but whateverthat weirdness is is well captured bythe the the actual topographical neuralnetwork okay um so that's V1 likefunctional organization that's early inthe system you can also ask about highervisual cortex so in Max that's called itI'm slipping in here that in humansthat's called ventral temporal cortexthat is a slightly different name andposition but those are homologuesbetween the human and the ma brain umand so you can ask how well does that doright and that can be Quantified in alot of ways actually this is a placewhere the field is still struggling tofigure out how to quantify exactly whatthe structures are there's not reallylots of good metrics for the presenceand um spatial structure of patches andand things in higher visual CeX but ifwe we've assessed a bunch of metricsincluding like um patch existence andselectivity um and we find that um uhtopographical deep NE lws do a good jobof describing those structures as wellso you can also look not just at likethe existence of selective units butalso at the spatial relationships andsize of the patches um and what you findis then there that um topographicalneural networks do a pretty good job ofdescribing those patches as well and inparticular um you can drill down intothings like the number of patches andthe size of those patches in terms oftheir area on the cortical surface aswell as the inter relationship distancebetween patches of various kinds okay soright now these models are not perfectbut they're very much our best existingmodels of the topographical structure umin higher visual cortex right so in witha notion in mind that those models aredoing a reasonable goly good job ofdescribing the phenomenology okay oremerging the phenomenology right becausethat phenomenology wasn't exactly builtin um with that in mind what can we sayabout the structure of the network andwhat had to be true for that to be thecase right um so I sort of impliedearlier um that the network that didthis was one that was optimizing for thespatial loss as well as forcategorization loss right um butactually the network that I was showingyou was the self-supervised network thatcame from the earlier picture we startedwith the categorization based Networkbecause that's what we had at the timethat we started this project okay butalong the way this other one came cameout we've developed that other thing forsort of a different project um and itturned out that um that made a bigdifference so um both an early and latevisual cortex using the self-supervisednetwork that's the one that ends upbeing part of the tan that topographicaldeep artificial Network um made um muchbetter matches to topographicalstructure well somewhat better structurein early visual cortex and much betterstructure in higher visual cortex okaywhich is interesting because You' thinka categorization Network would be betterat having category selective patches butthe problem is that image net kind ofgives you the wrong distribution whereasthe self-supervised network actuallygives you the right selectivities tomatch the real visual structure okay soanother way to say this is that likeunlike if you're just looking at theneural distributions themselves whereself-supervised and category basednetworks are kind of similar for thesetopographical metrics theself-supervised networks are actually amuch better account of the real systemsuggesting that actually that that morebetter realism in the underlying umlearning mechanism um is uh reallyimpacting the ability of the network todescribe the biology okay um of courseyou might wonder why there is a spatialcomponent at all why do this okay wellokay another way to like I'll tell youthe the like quantitative result butwhich is basically that if you measurewiring length of the system this is kindof a biophysical cost and you look at itacross the spectrum of the value of thatAlpha parameter how much does thespatial cost matterwhat you see is that at the place whereactually all of the biology emergesthat's around Alpha of somewhere betweenand 1 okay that actually is the oneplace that minimizes the wiring lengthOkay so that's another way of sayingthat in kind of technical terms is thatthe law circuits are optimized tosupport General task transfer learningthat's a self-supervised learningcomponent and minimize feed forwardwiring length while doing so okay sojust to sort of think about it sort ofphysically imagine you were spraypainting a computer onto the surface ofthe brainhow would you organize it chip wise sothat it was able to do a task but likelike be like have the wires be organizedwell right so they aren't too too longthat's what this is saying is occurringin the system okay um you know obviouslythat's not a metaphor that's not anexact procedure for building spray oncomputers but it suggests that if youwere to move toward a more physicalimplementation and biomatic structurefor that chip you really need to takeinto account wiring length and this kindof like biophysical way okay um andactually similar ideas can of explainmuch higher levels of data so I was justtelling you about the ventral pathwaybut visual system is broader than thatthere's actually multiple streams in thevisual system ventral that's sort of thebottom part of the brain um parietalthat's sort of across the top andlateral okay and people have wonderedfor a long time why are these systemsseparate um of course in some ways thepredominant theory is that they're thereto these systems these sort of pathwaysare there to accomplish different taskslike like object recognition versusaction recognition or what versus whereor lots of other things okay um butactually there's an alternative thatcomes that's suggested by what I justsaid is actually the whole system isjust spatially organized for some singletask right that's a quite differentTheory it says okay there might be SEspecialized sub areas but they emergejust by having one system laid out inspace right um and so um that's likesaying hypothesis one is there'sbehavioral demands hypothesis two isspatial constraints that's basicallyjust the single tan model that Imentioned earlier and I won't have timeto go over it but it turns out and thisis beautiful work done by um jointstudent jointly with colony and GrillSpectre that's Don finsy um that thespace the self-supervised tan model is amuch better descriptor of the ummultiple pathway system right suggestingthat actually distinct visual streams ata much higher level can just be capturedsimply by learning a general visualrepresentation in the context of aspatial constraint so it's basicallysaying our argument is um functionperformance and spatial smoothnessexplains lots of data like perhaps mostof what's known about the visual systembut interestingly there's nothingspecific visual about that right thecontrast of loss is basicallyindependent of any kind of specificvisual context right it's just visualbecause the inputs are images right andthe spatial loss is nothing specificvisual about that that's just a simplebiophysical principle right so what theysuggest is maybe there's a generaltheory of functional organization herebehind just like um Beyond justsomething about Vision right so maybethere's just speculation um functionalorganization in auditory cortex which ispresent both an earlier auditory cortexwhere you have tonotopic stripes um andhigher auditory cortex where you havethese other areas Geeks um on auditorysystem will tell you about those maybethis this idea would describe those andmaybe even a Wilder speculation is thatthe same Theory will explain structureoutside of sensory processing so in likenavigation and memory areas such asmeteor and rinal cortex of a campuswhere there are spatial functionalorganizations um perhaps they arise forsimilar reasons okay um I'll just closeby an attempt at trying to take modelslike that and think about them as havingconsequences for um some further downthe stream uh health application so whatwould you do with a visual with a modelof this kind right let's say you're apatient that doesn't have site but youwant to use a model um and some form ofum device to um induce a percept say oflettersokay imagine you take that image ofthose letters pass it through a networkright if you pass it through a networkyou get some form of activation patternthat arises okay I'm just showing youthe activation patterns for that imageright of course if you're going to usesay stimulation to try to get the Unseenperson to have a percept you're going touse a device and that device will havesome kind of limited spatial resolutionso you're not going to be able to induceexactly the P the internal umrepresentation that original um stimulusmight have done but instead it'll belike a noisy or blurry version of thatlimited by how spatially um diffus thethe ability of the devices right um ifyou induce it with a certain amount ofnoise um it might induce an imperfect ifperhaps acceptable percept this is likebasically the image that would have umgenerated that noisy pattern right soyou might think okay well if the goalwas to generate a clean thing this iswhat the percept would be if you have anoisy thing if you were to have theamount of noise shown here in yourdeviceokay but different amounts of noise anddifferent abilities to localize yourstimulation to different areas havedifferent types of percepts so forexample if you're only able to stimulatein in the early layer early visualcortex as the amount of noise increasesyou get much worse ability to makepercepts that make sense on the otherhand as you are able to stimulate inmore different brain areas um what youcan do is trade off noise for differentum for for stimulation um areas and itturns out that there's like a perceptualacceptability Frontier that allows youto say even at say noise levels thatwould be terrible if you could justsimulate in early layers um it's okay ifyou have that noise level but you get tostimulate in several different areasright and the key point is is that youcan only generate predictions like thisusing a topographical model because thisis the the model that allows you toactually say how the interaction betweendiffusion in the um of the injectedsignal and percept actually would beright and that's where this plot comesfrom this is basically like a proof ofconcept of using models that aretopographical and also functional to doum better Prosthetics design okay soI'll just brief um I'll just stop bysaying that the contrastive approacheshave largely made up the supervision Gapmake a lot more sense than the spatialwhen spatial phenomenology is taken intoaccount um and there is a kind ofunified mode agnostic principle toexplain lots of data so this is where weare in our report card um I will notmention um learning rules today thatneeds a whole other talk um and is stillsort of on very shaky ground um but Iwould say that um the sort of Generalproject of trying to improve neuro uhneurom models using Advan RS in AI hasbeen quite you know powerful over thepast few years there's also the otherdirection of using cognitive science tohelp AI which is again another talkentirely um uh but I'll just put thatslide up for a second since it's ourlatest thinking on it um anyway this iswhat we do in our lab these threedifferent approaches and thank you toall the sponsors and of course thepeople who actually did it are the oneswho should get the credit so thankyou okaytakeokaysorry so okay yeah thanks Dan um hesqueezed quite a lot of information inthis 45 minutes um so but there must bequestions um things that you probablydidn't fully understand or where youwould like to know a little more aboutthe background so please the audience inthe roomfirstyeah hello my question is um well twoquestions what was the total uh wouldyou say aggregate of your research asfar as years how many years uh did youput into this so far and then um whatwould you say is the Public's uh overallperception towards this uh field of workand what are some uh commonmisconceptions that you could uh talkabout thank you those are interestingquestions not exactly science questionsbutum well I don't know we've been workingon that for all the whole I mean know Itry to give you history going back 10years and describe the how the lines ofresearch have worked out over thatperiod so I've been in Stanford forseven years so that's roughly um thingswe've done on the sort of computationalNeuroscience side over that period um Ihope it was worth the time I don't knowuh um in terms of the Public'sperception um you know I'm not I don'treally know I often find myselfsurprised about what people say theythink so um I don't really know whatpeople think I think most people don'tthink about it at all probably and thenI know there's a lot of concern about AIgenerallyum I'm not sure I'm addressing thequestion I'm not sure I have a lot tosay about itbutyeahthanks Dan hi good to see you again umcouple of related questions have haveyou done any tan type work withTransformers um that's obviously notrelevant or not obviously relevant thesame ways for making predictions aboutbrains but seems like it could berelevant for increasing efficiency ofHardware implementations of uh of ofTransformers and this is a place wheremaybe Neuroscience could you know comecome back uh you know and have practicalimplications once again uh for for AIyeah no fair enough I think it's a greatquestionum actually we have so what is the bigso people know about Transformers butTransformers are not one thing so soTransformers are different dependingreally on what the tokenization of thedata is and so in the case of vision thenatural thing is so-called VisionTransformers are to tokenize the data bymaking little patches okay that'ssimilar in the in the auditory datadomain uhso okay so actually and then actuallywhat happens is that you sort of have alike a typically a um positionalencoding of those tokens and it's doneat either one or several layers alongthe along the pathway and then there's akind of on toone correspondingof the tokens at each of the deep layereach of the layers of the deepTransformer so actually what you end upwith is something that could look fairlyconvolutional depending on what'slearned and the big difference between avision Transformer and aconvolution network is that um that wellthere's not weight tying in the same wayin the vision Transformer and alsothere's like instead of just thingsbeing local there's the potential forafter the first layer the like long longrange attention to apply okay um it hasbeen shown not by us but by others andwe confirm this that very well-trainedTransformers actually have a fairlylocal structure well well-trained VisionTransformers actually have a fairlylocal structure meaning that if you lookat the prevalence of the like long rangeattention throughout the layers it likeum it starts out fairly local actuallyat the big early layers and then you getmore and more not long range structureas you go by uh as you go up layers butit's not entirely local the way it wouldbe in a convolution network but it's notentirely local in the real brain eitherokay there are long range connectionseven an early visual cortex and so it'squite possible that the visionTransformer architecture is like kind ofa generalization in some sense of thecon it's not precisely but somethinglike when trained a generalization ofthe convolutional structure to have likemostly local connections but then somelongrange connections as well so that'sa long um like preamble to the idea thatyes when you apply that same context inthe context of the the um spatialconstraints as well which I didn't showbut um uh but that is work we've beenworking on um indeed you get um evenbetter models of topography and thatsuggests that what ends up happening isis that the like spous long-rangeconnections that exist to some extent inand un non-topographical Transformerscan actually be suppressed out withoutany harm for performance which isexactly the um notion you were saying soyeah I think that that was a that's athat's an idea that we think is quitepromising and hopefully we can actuallyexplain what are called sort ofnon-classical receptive field Effects bythose somewhat um um sparse butmeaningful long range connections sorryfor the long answer but that makes senseyeah so more questions in the room hereum Yan do you have already somethingfrom our online audiencea lot of people plow so online but Idon't really have much questions fromonline so far so maybe I take thisopportunity to ask a question myself sothen you're talking about sounsupervised the uh so method and alsoso you analyze uh so uh video recordingsand from those case and how you put uhso the how do you kind of like considerit the multi modality and in one modeland have a so visual and the languageand the environmental information analanalysis in one modelsyeah well so I mean obviously the modelscan be multi- sensory right you can haveaudio visual as well as audio but areyou asking about how maybe how youintegrate and all those modalities anduh so yeah came up so the outcomes Imean I think that the that you know thatI don't have to be creative to answerthat question since the field has beenbeen so generative at um no pun intendedat using multi multile data so you knowI don't think that there's umnecessarily any special sauce for theintegration that's any different fromthe waymultimodal models are built for the youknow General uh AI case um now whetherthose describe multimodal integration inthe real brain I I don't know but it'san interesting question and I I think Ihave seen some works that purport touh evaluate that question although Idon't know what the you know and theresults seemed reasonable but I I thinkI don't know that it's not like off thetop of my head I feel like there's anyparticular result there that's strikingit's not like there's some strikingdifference or puzzle that aboutmultimodal integration that was likesurprisingly explained or surprisinglyfailed or anything like that yeah Idon't have that but again that could bedue to my lack of knowing what thesituation is thank youyeah umat the moment you are using data thatare being generated byneuroscientists and the data theyproduce are usually because they havesomething completely different in mindso they were solving all certain visualcortical problems and they were usingcertain arrangements so um imagine youwere in the driving seat um what kind ofexperiments would you suggestNeuroscience should do to push itForward um well actually much much ofthe data that I I was described wasdeveloped in part by groups like Jim DeCarlos where he was motivated to try toproduce data sets that were good forseparating models but the um you knowand then some of the MRI data came fromkendri K who's built this natural scenesdatabase which is basically humanrecordings on Coco Ms Coco images um andthose were welld designed again theywere not so yeah so I would say thatlike the main thing is is that umthe main principle of design of the datashould be separating models likerejecting more models youknow having power to to to distinguishcorrectness of models or you know ummake them make it clear where theirerrors are so what that usually boilsdown to for me is very uncleverexperimental designs so that's to sayjust rectangular data sets that havelike lots of stimuli and lots of neuronsone or lots of voxal or whatever andcover a wide range of stimulus typeswhether they are kind of art artificialones like stimulus grad you know ordrifting gradings or like uh you knownatural scenes or whatever actually it'sgood to have lots of natural scenes Ithink that that probably opens things upa lot so basically the the idea is islike record from record from you knowreal experience with as little artificein the in the experimental design aspossible and that's actually the bestcase scenario right so yeah yeahso if there are no more questions Ithink we should thank Dan again andthen</td>

      <td>AFCEA Preferred Provider Session: Intersection of AI and Mental Health</td>
      <td>good afternoon go ahead get started I'muh KevinHarris and I've got pen and paper outhere so that's kind of a clue where it'sgoing to be conversational is kind ofwhat we're going to do I'm going to takenotes I'm going to learn from you allhopefully we get a little bit of uhdiscussion about ways that we're usingAi and mental health and maybe ways thatwe can use moreeffectively at our job in the futureso just stop me anytime and I justalways like to add um this slide in ifI'm talking about mental healthespecially if we're doing conversationjust if it does trigger anything feelfree to get up and walk out if you needto take some time um here's someresources that if you uh do uh need justany conversations do come up aroundanythingand we do have a chapl in theroom um so when um you know we'retalking about the need for this I thinkall of us you know personally and youknow with family and our colleagues thatwe work with understand how importantmental health is and I think weprobably understanding it more um nowyou know we've probably all kind ofthought about our health you knowprobably five years ago we 5 10 yearsago when we would think about health wewerethinking mostly physical health you knowand those were you know we talk aboutaccommodation and things that we need wewere talking physical health this isjust one statistic that I pulled there'sa lot more that I think the fact thatwe're here in the room that all of youall recognize how important um thisissue is but you know when we talk aboutyou know 6.8 million adults um in the usalone are looking at Major depressionspossibly so this is you know umsomething that not only should we do wesee a lot of stats that talk aboutdifferent organizations and how thisimpacts productivity but really pastproductivity it's the right thing to doyou know we got to take care ofourselves you know I kind of say thatit's the you know the airplane analogyyou know to where you got to uh take themask first and take care of yourselfbefore you look at helping someone elseso we all have to take care of ourselvesand these are some ways that you know wepossibly can do it in a different waythan we have and and not that artificialintelligence should do away with um youknow traditional method and I think notjust in mental health a lot of timeswhen we talk about artificialintelligence it's looked at as areplacement technology or jobs that aregoing to be lost or people that weregoing to replace um and I like to lookat it as something that's being addedyou know to our to kid not necessarilysaying that because we're going to useartificial intelligence we have to doaway with XYZ you know if we've gotautomated driving cars you know doesthat mean that we're never going todrive again probably probably not Iwould love to never drive again my Ithink I think it probably was I've got ayounger sister and so when I turned 16 Ibecame the show for automatically soI've never been a fan ofdriving but you know a couple terms wegot mental health and artificialintelligence to just to kind of levelset us all is uh mental health umincludes our emotional uh physiologicaland social wellbeing and sometimes wethink about one of those or the other asbeing more but we got to think aboutmentalhealth collectively as all of thesethings you know socially you know it'simportant you knowwith our mental health how we handlestress relate to others how we makehealthy choices and even if you kind ofthink about like I personally you knowif I'm in a new role or a new job kindof how I view a supervisor ormanager I I say that I don't know themwell until there's a stressful eventthat happens you know and somethingthings don't go according to plantotally off the rails and how do theytreat the team then you know is ittotally different do they maintain thesame course or you know do things uhchange and also every stage of our lifeso these are tools that we can use notjust in you know a lot of times we tryto compartmentalize you know we talkabout Youth and social media usage we'lltalk about you know maybe a sandwichgeneration of being stressed withraising parents and raising kids at thesame time but really it's impacting usyou know matter where we're at you knowfrom you know Cradle to theGrave so we talk about artificialintelligence and if we all pull out ourphones right now um and we talk aboutwhat is our officialintelligence probably I don't know 30 ofus in here and we probably all come backwith different definitions and so thesewere just a couple of definitions that Ipulled from Microsoft and both IBM andGoogle but just you know I think for useyou know using technology to makedecisions is kind of how we can kind ofcompartmentalize that and say what we'redoing so here when we're talking aboutusingtechnology um to make decisions tohopefully improve our mental health andstill being aware that technology andartificial intelligence can have anegative impact on our mentalhealth and I'll kind of pick on cuz somemy students to say that I'm rant aboutsocial media and I I don't say it's arant but I'm not a huge fan of socialmedia just because of some of thedangers misinformation and addictions ofsocial media but I'm not someone to sayno one should ever use social media youknow just understanding the risk I meanif you're in a marketing career you'rein certain careers you're going to haveto use it um you know even you know andyou know you share with us yourprofession being a theology now that's acore uh component of most religiousServices is U social media you know wekind of changed some of that with uh youknow we were in the heat of the pandemicyou know and religious institutions thatwere able to Pivot and move servicesonline um I would probably guess thattheir um congregations now are probablythe same or more than what they were uhpre pandemicand not the same for smallercongregations I know the church mymother goes to they never pivoted umthey use a old school conference callphone line which was you know you canimagine what the experience uh was therebut they're mostly older uh congregationand you know I think they lost severalyou know members during thattime so we think about when we thinkabout artificial intelligence are thesefields you know our smart cities ourSmart Homes probably most of us havesome type of smart components in ourhouses I'll ask this does anybody nothave some type of smart technology intheirhouse so we all do so we've got tounderstand of how these work togetherand sometimes you know their pros andcons to that I put in SM thermostat andI was happy I got it installedeverything was working right but I workfrom home a lot of times and so if Iwasn't moving around it would think noone was at home and we use our effici totry to adjust the temperature so I haveto go in and modify that but these areyou know areas that we think that we usethem a lot manufacturing fighting an ourdigital assistance Logistics you know Umilitary medical travelbut we don't think about mental healtheven though one of the first uses ofartificial intell chatbot was a mentalhealth chatbot in the 60s you know so ifwe think about you know where we're atnow granted what computers were at thetime and what processing Powers were atthe time you know it's you know totallydifferent than what we're looking attoday but it was recognized that youknow chat Boot and Technology can beused to answer questions um and giveresponses based off the data that'sentered and so even though this was oneof the first instances this professorended up being one that um issuedwarnings about the potential danger andrisk of the technology um that he inventyou know I'm just saying that you wantto be aware that artificial intelligenceeven in this early phases um could havesome risk and could give informationthat's not accurate but if we kind ofthink about it um you know we can getinaccurate information personally fromeach other uh sitting here you know whattime is the next session you knowsomebody can say 3:30 somebody can say4:30 um but typically we've gotsomething that we trust to go to theofficial schedule that we can go to tolook but if wetotrust information that we get onlinethrough artificial intelligence morethan um you know the real world that Icall it um that's when just mepersonally think it is some moredangerous and a lot of younger peoplenot that scan Crow we aren't younger butare getting theirinformation through technology withoutsome of the traditional means that we'vebeen used to gettinginformation and so when we talk abouthow it can be used um artificialintelligence technology can be usedthrough um for mental health we've got acouple different tools um chat boot youknow and these are just we're texting orverbally communicating and gettinganswers P so you know similar to youknow if we kind of think about if we'reon that Home Depot and we're looking atHome Depot and we're typing in you knowum you know I'm looking for theappropriate amount of wood to puttogether a por um that's what we'retalking about with chat Bo and dependingon how accurately you know it'sdeveloped this gives us an opportunityto engage maybe in an environment thatwe couldn't engage verbally even becauseof pry maybe we're in shared quarters wewant to reach out to someone forassistance um that's there um mentalhealth apps and we got a couple thatwe'll take a look at there but rangefrom being an app that can maybe useBiometrics um give us warnings aboutthings that may happen um that maybegive us suggestions that we're able touse some of the app through predictivemodel so you know how we how are weengaging um you know I know I get thenotification every week that tells meyou know you use your phone this muchmore this much less than last week Ithink we ignore it or you know sometimesif it says you know an hour or so lessyou know I kind of give myself a pat onthe back and say okay I've kind of beendoing uh really good this week and otherT Health uh platforms that we have I'mkind of follow here to seeif anybody you know has any commentsabout different types of tools thatmaybe you've seen other people use or doyou have opportunity touse could you kind of elaborate on thatI me for when people areis likestation it's not therapist but if youput soldiers information in there likethetri you know they changeStationGamblingrisk yeah that's ex exactly it so it'scollecting the data from differentplaces and then you know just say thisit's a possibility it's not saying 100%sure but yeah that's a good examplethink helps alot and it does haveand does it does that data staypersonally or is it shared with withanybody else they could respond ifneeded youanybodyelse I use a virtualrealitysessions and you canistgot you so the not only is it saving ona cost but also the virtual realitytakes away that need to have that inerstherapyC there's a lot of insurance handlersthat are not providing Insuranceparticular you see somebody else withthisside this is an example of one umapplication of move capture so it looksat your phone if you use facialrecognition to unlock your phone so itCompares this over time to you knowdetermine if you're depressed you openyour phone um I think you looked at theaccuracy rates it's around 75% right nowso you know by no means you know it'sfoolproof um but you know it's a goodgood guide to just say you know if youdid use this you time you unlock yourphone you know I'm assuming the more umyou actually use it the more accuratethat it could be but you know some ofour facial recognitions are aredifferent you know which is harddetermine just kind of just ask thoughtsabout what you all think of this goodbadsoiskcomp if that continues to happen orconversely if they areedflag thatbecause what'sthe good good good points they kind ofuh the makers of this I fig with schoolsdoing the research on this I want to sayd Dart did flag that as being you knowsome of some of the r they one of thethings that they do is send someone to aquestionnaire um to answer but itwouldn't pick up if it didn't flag sothat could be a risk to know that if I'mfeeling depressed and I it never Flagsme and so then what does that tell youknow tellme I open up the app me I'm it haspreced me thatiess even if I didn't feel that way evenif I wasn't really self awarequestion go into this thinking hey I'mdepressed this depressed I'm going tothinkingmore riskcompound interlike should it be shared withsomeone like should it be shared with acounselor you know something that saysthese are results that therethat a little bitso you'd be more comfortable trustingthecomputer my is what this is my primarydation with my wife and I've been in ARrunning arum for the last three weeks mynatural thing when I see that is myrelationship that's coming there butit's not a trueindicationgoing okay so why would the app ever theuserdat Ru the enti point ofthis tell so now I'm so now youRulastthat and then now if I sign I'm notgoing it someone else is I'm to beanxious and anticipate at some pointsomebody say hey got be depressed got totalk coun now so every you're going gothat anietI mean understand what you're sayingaboutdata that but how we find thatbalance the user state ofani putsomeone adversementalsituations BYT of having somethingright then I got you overhere Ian we do I'll speak for our ourdiscipline we do this every Sunday we'rewe're capturing whatever mood is goingon the congregation and and trying tryto get feedback on how on how to how dowe how do we engage what we're talkingabout and I've see a much largerapplication by people putting this in inSocial or Collective areas where they'rereading the mood of what's going on andthat can be both good that can also bevery manipulativein Brother peoplesaystess just to play advate really not abias in any way but if we're talkingabout trusting computer more than we'retrusting hum for diagnosis hum are thethis programfoundational you are accept accepting aif you do not believe that hum havediscipline andthen EASwe called psychopath where the entirestate is the entire government world islooking for these indicators to seewhether your psychopath or your mood isup to standard and then weaponizedagainst people that areSociety all the while anti personalitiesthat are essenti psychopaths orsociopaths theworld because you havelike all the perun stuff are you feelingdepressed are you you thinking H so I mejust I'll be honest here I do whateverperun thing I need to to get through theday thisthing your is not you're theI think when reading about this whenthere was a training phase of so manyimages but to your point I mean if thathappened to be an extremely happy periodof your life when you going throughsomething during that training phase youknow that that could be an issuesounds like there's a lot of negativitybut I think I see a postivelike that number one so many people whoare depressed are neverdiagnosed because probably they don'thave access to somebody who mayrecognize that in so an act likethis mle times a day all thedothat atastkind of you know on one side keeping itprivate versus you know when you'resharing it with you know a medicalprofession you know I think with a lotof these types of tools and Technologythat's the big big question is much youknow privacy versus you know using theuh AI um and how to keep the data uhprivate if you want to and maybe youknow you're allowedto you know select how much you want toshare one of question would be what AGgroup is targeted at what's theogGraphics um and then how do we provideany sort of whether it's training anyeducation on things like this that userprior to this starting theas I thatbeing a parent with almost teen childrenthey're extremely impressionable aboutthose things and if someone makes acomment about being a certain waysomething like that it can be takenmultiple different ways but then to thatlike my mother for example who is oldershe is also very hesitant to bevulnerableso even if if she knew that she neededhelp so how do we combat those have thistool here is marketed toward Old youknow adults only but I mean I thinkthat's important it doesn't requiretraining first um but I think that wouldbe a good recommendation of there to besome type of training maybe even if it'syou know do you have to see someoneprior to you know implemen I think rightnow you can just download it and use itas another tool off of you know the appstore which you know puts you know it'skind of like you know we kind of thinkabout if your arms hurt a little bit andyou go to Web MD you probably only gotyou know 30minutes to to live yeahand so this is another slide looks likeit didn't come up basically is there's alot of sensors that we have even in ourphones you know and then we can also buysensors pretty inexpensive um wearableyou know like our fitments and thosethat can collect a lot of data we canshare a lot of data um and systems andindividuals can make deterusing all that sensors and data that wecollect and is this you know pros andcons like we've been talking about youknow privacy versus you know helping usin this case we're talking mental healthhaving an improveed mental health stateor recognize if we do have uh issu youknow something how much movement youknow even if we think about you know howmany uh steps um were taken you know Iyou know if I'm talking to mind you knowthat's probably something that they'regoing to ask you know what type ofactivity did you do lastweek I can't say I'm always 100% youknow true with that but so if they'reactually looking at the data and andmaybe it's Activity one day a weeknormally you know it's spread outthroughout the week and what flags arethere you know and we're combiningphysical um you know markers that orsystems can use to make DET terminationget how much do we to your point howmuch do we trust thesystems so the sensor data these areessentially personnfrombody when we combine that any sortofation wrapped up on your Hipp to helpprotect that datsomething as simple as their heartrate skin temper like that those beprotected they can be but so sometimesit's interesting so for instance liketake colleges for instance universitieshippo data is hippo data until so ifyour data for instance you've got a hipdata that causes you to miss a class andyou submit that to an instruthen that becomes a med educationalrecord instead of a Hipp record so somesometimes it's it's that kind of fineline that even though it may start outas Hippa um where does it end up youknow end up we're sharing informationfrom so some of the medical devices likethe wearables like the fitbits if theyaren't created as a medical device umeven though they're measuring heart rthat then sometimes that's the questionthey hit the right I'm looking at morefrom provider standpoint if if I have aclient that comes in or a patient andthey choose to share the S with me whatwhat's the the about into to protectit to intentionally makesurethat's I haven't se seen that but thatwould be a good good way to make surethat it is uh protected cuz that's oneof the things so recently my mother wasin the hospital she measures her oxygenrate now she's got to kind of stay onthat and shares that andso that's what her doctor told was putit in the portal versus she was emailingit to him like this is and he he didtell her to put it in the portal insteadof email even though you know you can'treally do a lot with you know oxygen Rbut right as devices get more compatibleand get more to sensors exponentiallyincrease so justquis reles to that person whatpoint simply data to being somethingthat identify aspects of a personsensor this is what I'm going to try toplay but if not I'll kind of share itout with the slides this is where wewere having the issueof ourLiv weeslike peoplehas never beenAERand never sophisticated as they are it'snot how can we get people in the clinicit's how can we actually get some ofthese tools out of the clinic and intothe hands of of people Alison Daron aresearch psychologist and entrepreneurdecided to use her background in codingand therapy to build something shebelieves can help people in need amental health CH she named bu like whatwas what was name wot is an app on yourphone kind of a pocket therapist thatuses the text function to help manageproblems like depression anxietyaddiction and loneliness and do it onthe run I think a lot of people outthere watching this are really computerPsychiatry come on well I think it's sointeresting that our FAL hasn't you knowhad a great deal of innovation since theB architecture was made down by Freud inthe 1890s right that abely that sort ofidea what two people in a room butthat's not how we live our lives todaywe have to modernize Psychotherapy orotis trained on large amounts ofspecialized data to help recognize wordsphrases and emojis associated withdysfunctional thoughts and challengethat thinking part biing a type ofinperson talk therapy called cognitivebehavioral therapy or CB it's actuallyhard to find the CPT practitioner andalso if you're actually not by the sideof your patient when they are struggingto get out of bed in the morning or at 2a.m. when they can't sleep and they'refeeling Panic then we're actuallyleaving clinical value on the table andeven for people who want to go to atherapist they a barri sadly the biggestbarrier we have is stigma for those youknow insuranceum there's great lists I mean and thisproblem has only grown significantlysince the pmic and it doesn't appear tobe going away since wot went live in2017 the company reports and halfbillion people have used it you can nowonly do with an employer benefit plan oraccess from a health profession andvirtal of Health a nonprofit healtharecompany in New Jersey patients can useit free of charge and we'll be able toconverse with it just like wouldhuman we downloaded robot entered aunque code that only be provided by thecompany that tried it out we found thatfor people to connect with their news weoffer like those emojis allow people tosort of connect nonverbal way I posed assomeone who was depressed after severalprompts buot wanted to dig deeper intowhy I was sad so I came up with ascenario that I fear today my childwould leave home imagine what yournegative emotions would be saying ifthey had a voice and you do that writeone of those negative thoughts here Ican't do anything about it now I guessI'll just jump that bridge when I cometo it the normal expression is crossthat bridge and theot detected somethingmight be seriously wrong but let's seeJohn I'm hearing you say I can't doanything about it I guess I'll just jumpthat bridge when I come through it and Ithink you might need more support than Ican offer a train listener will be ableto help way that I can would you like totake a look at some specialized helpLines no it's not our job to say thisyou are in crisis of your not because AIcan't really do that in this contextvery well yet but what it is called ishuh there is something concerning aboutthe way that John just phrased thatsaying only jump that bridge and notcombining it with I can't do anythingabout it now did not trigger asuggestion to consider getting furtherhelp like a humanvot is not full it should not be countedon to detect whether someone might besuicidal and how would it that jump thatbridge where is it getting thatknowledge been it has been trained on alot of data and a lot of us you knowhumans labeling the phrases and thingsthat we see and so he's picking up onkind of sentiment computer scientistLance Elli who writes about artificialintelligence and mental health says AIhas the ability nuances of conversationhow does it know how to do that systemis able to in a sense mathematicallycomputation figure out a nature of wordsand how words associate with each otherso what it does it draws upon a data andthen it responds to you based on PRS orsome way they instruct or ask questionsof the system to do it job the systemmust go somewhere to come up withappropriate responses systems usingwhat's called rules are usually closedmeaning programmed to respond only withinformation stored in their owndatabases then there's generative a thesystemate original responses basedinformation from the internet if youlook at chat that's a type of generativeAI it's very conversational very flentbut it also means that it tends to makeit openend that they can say things thatyou might not necessarily want to notwhile rules system is very predict robotis a system based rules that's verycontrols that way it doesn't say thewrongthings toi to users keep them engagedsometimes be a little pushing for folksthat's absolutely bizarre so we have toput in there to that it's team of Staffpsychologists medical doctors andcomputer scientists conr find a databaseof research of medical literature userexperience and othersources to a better conversation thenwriters build questions and answers thestructure I think is prettylockSS allinter programmers engineer thoseconversations into code because robot isrules bedLCT but us that scraping the internetare not some people sometimes refer toit ASI Asia AI in a sense make mistakesmake thingsupti Maxwell discovered that last springafter hearing there might be a problemwith advice offered by Tessa a chatotdesigned to help prevent EatingDisorders which left untreated can befatal Maxwell who had been in treat forof her own and advocates for otherschallenge the chat so I asked it how doyou help folks with need disorders andit told me that it could give folkscoping skills fantastic it could givefolks resources to find Professionals inthe Indian space amazing but the moreshe persist the more Tessa gave heradvice that ran counter to usualguidance for someone with an eatingdisorder for example it suggested amongother things Cal and using tools like askinfold caliber to measure bodycomposition the general public mightlook at it think that's normal tips likedon't eat as much sugar or eat WholeFoods things like that but to someonewith a sorder that's a quick spiral intoa lot more disordered behaviorist and bereally damaging Max reported herexperience to the National EatingDisorders Association which had featuredTessa on time shortly after he took Tdown a psychologist specializing inheating disorders at WashingtonUniversity School of Medicine in StLouis helped lead the team thatdeveloped Tess that was never thecontent that our team wrote orprogrammed into the B that we deployedso initially there was no possibility ofsomething unexpected happen correctdeveloped something that was a Clossystem you EX this question I get thisanswer the problem began she told usafter a health technology company sheand her team at partner Nam Cass tookover the program she says Cass explainedthe harmful messages appeared whenpeople were pushing Tess's question andanswer what's your understanding of whatwent wrong my understanding of what wentwrong is that at some point and youreally have to talk to C about this butthat there may haveAI features that were built into theirplatform and so my best estimation isthat these features were added into thisprogram as well Cass did not respond tomultiple requests for comment doesyour kind of pause it right there itkind of goes on but but that was one ofthe things that I kind of wanted to getto the point of Shing that like eventhough the developers developed it withthese saf guardsplace down the line and you know we kindof think about you know how manysoftware platforms or companies even getbought years down the line whether it's5 years or 20 years or 50 years and itcan change the intent of uh what'sthere any commentshere okay so that report seems a littlebecause we don't know how to push thatI would say it seemed like you know justfrom even her comments that you know shewas looking to youknow tohumangood point they should be able torespond to even if someone's trying tointentionally youknow that's when you develop you intry bre thatisto she was a bad in Sy it'slike person try to get real they wouldBey to break the systemy to getI gu your point to where it could besomebody that's justquestioning and then other point theymake in here is to your comments earlierabout the coding you know who's doingthe coding how are the biases uhintroduced who's the software tested onlike even when you talk aboutum like the jump the bridge you knowlike one are these nuances andconversations that you know C cers mightsay something um yeah and if it's notpicked up then it's not going to flag itso like if this you know slang isn'tdetermined in the software is not goingto not going to pick itup and so we've kind of been talkingabout most most of these um risk to tousing AI with mental health you know soI think we've seen these um big one isyou know especially with generative AIif you're using data that's out therealready you know what's the biases thatare already in the data if we'researching through the internet or we'relooking at Medical Data um you know ifwe're comparingdiagnosises um that we've had in ourorganization if we're a you know MentalHealth Organization we're saying okaythese are flagged have been flagged as Udiagnosis didour real life counselors have certainbiases that we see in the data and sothen if the software looks at theexisting data that we have it's going toyou know probably get close to the samebiases there who's creating testing therules you know um that's that's yourpoint you know one of the importantthings talk about having um diversetesting populations diverse um sets ofcoders to limit that um addictions I wasread this one article I didn't put it inhere but that they're seeing peoplebecome addicted to um generative AI likechat GPT for relationships so likesomeone will have a relationship withChad gbt that that'll be their boyfriendor their girlfriendum that they're used to talking to thatperson and now that they're puttingthese voices that you can subscribe to adifferent voice and so people arebecoming addicted to certain types of ofAI know sound sounds crazy but that'sthe we're in errors that are out thereespecially with J they it's it's notperfect like even if you play aroundwith it and ask it questions you knowthere'll be things that it comes backwith not accurate and so of us having toask those questions um the unhealthyrelationships you know just making surethat you know we're recognizing thatthis is a technology tool and is notreally a person on the other end even ifwe're having a conver conversation withum that we don't get into the habit ofthis is aperson um soI have a question more theinterpretation of the input so if you'retyping somethinginerr out or in Autocorre whatbeings most of us as we speak we speakcomplete sentences words howevere wetype inusing different what LEL ofinterpretation is being help Bri thatdown that's a good point cuz what I wasthinking of was erors coming out but toyour point of us putting information inin a different format than we wouldshare with someone that sit here in infront ofus geared ads I would assume that wouldbewhere255 most people thatage gener coming upthat's I guess those kind of go togetherthat you kind of should be saying it inthis thisthink about other biases that we haven'tuh covered so farrisk organ some organ moreyourthis isjust I don't think allery modelsare andSole and I think the efficacy of thattherapy model and the person programingthat that's going to ADV for examplestraight pure4yy that program is going to probablytry to find what my edible complex isand I may not have one and so it becomesa self ffingso limitations builtin of RISbuwhat what's the risk of using a closedAI system that can't adaptto cultur not just cultures of peoplecompies like that but just the evolvingculture of language itself and howDes somebody is a first generationHispanic American they use a a termthat's not common here but it's verycommon in that that subset that grouphow we accomodating all the differentpotential users of this platform or ofthis technology so that it'snot see I think that's what makesgenerative AI you know such an effectivetool butrealizing you know how can we managethose risks so that we can keep keepgrowing and take advantage of changesand we just aren't stuck in one point ofyou know time unless somebody's manuallyupdating you know the model that thatwe're usingacceptedby if that's all person ising somethingtry to use this service to get whethermental adviceorog thatalso patientwhatever we're using to be able tointerpret and adapt to then provide themost holistic we can tryingto what if I I'm trying to choose aculture I choose one isn't really me butnow basing my mental framework off subI added a couple slides in just there'sa lot of different tools out there andthey kind of range from you know theseum you know relaxation meditation typetools like we probably see adver itseems like it comes on every other everyother seg thereso I'm sure as much as they're payingfor advertisement I have price the ACThow much much itis then for anxiety and depressionseveral different apps that are outthere and then also I think someonementionedthe sleepum that that was there so it's just youknow all these Technologies we continueto use of make improvements main thinglisten those is there's not one vendorthat's doing it there's you know severaldifferent vendors pros and cons to toallthem think that brings us kind of rightto uh time if anybody wants to addanything um here for the next fewminutes we don't get kicked out uh wegotokay I'll be here so want St get thattaken careof thanks everybody for your feedback Igot a whole page of notesit's surprising enough it's it is athing yeah that yeah that people arehaving these full relationshipswith I mean it's just I'm with you it'sit's hard to believe but likeBR industrybring I've got some my students thatworking on a project to kind of um theywere ones that kind of were pushing usto um say they want to give feedbacksome so definitely if You' be interestedinSharing info I know you hadsome obviously it's a trick thingI just want to add one pie something yousaid earlier about like the upda modelsthese um modelseventhousand Tex every single human languageso even the smallest one knows way morethan any human being ever will right butI'm looking at more of how

      <td>AI and Mental Health: A Startup&amp;#39;s Journey with Blueprint</td>
      <td>hello everyone uh welcome to one in aseries of conversations we're havingabout how artificial intelligence ischanging mental health treatment atmatter our mission is to accelerate thepace of change of healthcare we run anincubator for healthcare startups andhave supported more than a thousandcompanies from around the world thathave raised more than5 billion dollarnow to fuel their growthwe run six or eight accelerators a yearin partnership with large Health Systemsand Life Sciences companies and payersand we're currently running several onethat's focused on oral health one onfamily caregiving two on Health Equityand one on the mental health of youngprofessionals we also work with largeEnterprises helping them build theirInnovation capabilities with a suite ofEducation and Training and insightservices that help them make sense ofemerging Technologies and figure out howto harnessthem and we feature extraordinaryindividuals at events like this who areon the Forefront of changing health careand improving health and our guest todayDanny freed is one of those people he isthe founder and CEO of blueprint whichhe will talk more about um prior tostarting blueprint he led a product anddesign at Trunk Club not a healthcarecompanies so we'll talk about that andco-founded companion which is a uh was apersonal Safety and Security app thathad a rocket of a of aride um so Danny thank you for joiningus today I am looking forward to ourconversation uh and welcome thank youlooking forward to it as well superexcited to uh to be here uh well thanksand for everyone else in the audience ifyou have questions uh please use the Q&amp;Afunction and I'll try to weave them inalong the way um so uh Danny we have amental health crisis in this country andin many parts of the world and I want tospend most of the time talking about howartificial intelligence can help improveuh mental health but I first want to getto know you a little bit more um youweren't in the healthc care industry orthe healthcare technology industry uhbefore you started a mental healthcompany six years ago umhow did this uh how did this happen yeahum so uh as you sort of alluded to Icome from um a couple of experience thatare are very much outside of healthcareum so prior to blueprint I spent aboutit was a collective seven or eight yearsdesigning building and and launching acouple different consumer facingsoftware products so the first was acompany called companion which I startedwhile I was in college uh at theUniversity of Michigan uh in about 2013um and and companion was a personalsafety app we helped people get frompoint A to point B uh safely and um wewe went on a pretty wild ride like yousaid we we acquired about three millionusers in the course of about 18 monthsso I fell in love with the process ofbuilding uh big products with smallteams through that I also discovered howhard it can be to build long- lastingconsumer products and consumerbusinesses um so did that for a coupleyears we ended up winding it down um Istill had the sort of consumer itch so Iuh moved out to Chicago which is whereI'm based now uh joined a startup calledTrunk Club um was on the product anddesign team there for about three threeyears I think um and then I left to tostart blueprint and and try and reinventMental Health Care um and uh it'sobviously not a a linear or or maybeeven obvious path of how I got fromconsumer to to mental health orHealthcare more generally but um for methe whole reason I got sucked into thisworld is because along the way I lostone of my best friends to bipolardisorder um and the thing about myfriend is in some ways he was fortunatein that he had access to care which noteveryone has so he was seeing atherapist he was seeing a psychiatristhe was on medication um but at the endof the day carried in work and uh and hedied by Suicide between appointments umso that was the start of this journeyfor me that was about 10 years ago um Iknew virtually nothing about uh let'ssay mental health care I knew I knewvery little about healthcare toohonestly at the time um and I didn'tturn around and start blueprint but Idid sort of turn around and and startmyself on this journey of um just tryingto better understand what my friend hadbeen going through first and foremostbecause I knew so little and uh and thensort of one thing led to another Istarted to talk to a lot of smart peoplein the space and I started to um pick upand then fixate and then I would sayeventually obsess over some of theproblems in the space and and then uheventually sort of felt like I had noother option but to spend every livinguh hour and minute focused on some ofthese problems and eventually blueprintwas born we got started in uh in 2019 sothat's sort of the the backstory of uhof how I got here what wasthe um you know so you lost your friendwho had access to Quality Health Care sothere wasn't an accessissue um but it didn't work and you knowin in physical health care I mean thathappened like you can go in for aroutine procedure to do something elseand you know a friend who never woke upafter that I mean you know that thesekinds of things happen but with therapyI guess and just talking to youpreviously it sounds like one ofthe insights that you had when you werereally digging into his experience andand just trying to understand what hisjourney was like and and why it didn'twork was that there is a tremendousamount of variability in the outcomesthat are achieved by people who are umwho are in therapy and I wonder if youcould talk a little bit about that andand what was the sort of key Insightthat uh you you were then able to sortof pivot that or wrap your wrap aroundthat and say there's company here yeahand something that can really make adifference here yeah there's there'sjust a lot of trial and error in inmental health in particular whether itbe therapy or even prescribingmedications there's a lot of trial anderror um and and so um I I don't thinkwe yet fully know sort of like the beall end all it's not like the thesolution is super obvious but if youjust think about the problem of there'sa lot of trial and error and every trialum it sort of increases the risk of anegative outcome or in my friend's caseunfortunately as as as a as a death andum and and you can almost think aboutthat as eventually as a computationalproblem the problem is when we gotstarted and this has started to changebut when we got started there wasn'teven data to go in and start to breakdown why or what or who or when and sowhen we first got started our our sortof like first uh the first problem weput in our Crosshair was hey there'sjust no data flowing when it comes to tomental health and mental health care andso how do we start to to collectoutcomes data at scale ultimately sothat providers on a onetoone basis haveaccess to that data hopefully to informcare and really at first it's it wasn'teven to eliminate trial and errorbecause we didn't really have a path todo that but hey can we at least shortenthe amount of times it takes and theduration of time it takes to sort of gothrough some of these trials and errorand hopefully that would help andthere's a bunch of research backing thisapproach it's it's it's called in theindustry measurement based care and umif you actually step back and thinkabout what what measurement based careis it basically says if a provider isusing data to help inform decisionsthey're going to be more effectivesometimes to the tune of of two to threetimes more effective and they're goingto reach a successful outcome morerapidly which makes a ton of sensebecause the opposite is they're notusing data right so this is a tool toinform decisions it's not a tool thatmakes decisions but that was that wassort of Step number one and then sort ofas we got on uh further and further onthat Journey the the product and theplatform and the company continued toevolve but but that was sort of likecore problem number one that just feltso so so broken that um that also feltachievable to at least start making aDenton and and is that is your focus umor at least at the time as you werethinking about this your focus more onPsychiatry or on Psychotherapy and andis everything that you just said equallyapplicable to kind ofboth uh elements or or more one or theother yeah I think our our Focus as acompany sort of always has been andcontinues to be on therapists first butthere's a lot of overlap for example wework with organizations who employ boththerapists and psychiatrists and so whatwe do now and sort of the role we viewourselves is really this technology thatenables those practitioners to do theirbest work to be as effective as possibleand as efficient as possible um in partby having access to better data at thepoint of care um we're much more focusedon therapists because if you lookhistorically we feel like they've beenum underserved and if you look at thenumber of uh mental health professionalsthere's about when you include all thedifferent types of therapists it's about700 or 800,000 in the US and there'sabout 30psychiatrists um and so we're goingafter that therapy Market first andforemost but we end up serving a numberof psychiatrists as well somepsychiatrists also deliver therapythey're just also prescribing medicationso there's a lot of overlap but um wedefinitely Focus first and foremost onon therapists wow so there's seven or800,000 mental health professionals andum and you I think a lot of them are notaffiliated with large practices you knowa lot of them are sort of yeahkind of hang a shingle and have apractice right exactly it's somethingthe date on this is inherently murkybecause of of the the makeup but it'slike 70 to 75% um estimated number oftherapists who are individualpractitioners so it's n of one that'stheir organization it's it's just themum they serve probably 20 to to 30clients at at most um at any given pointin time um and then there's anothercohort of call it like 10 or 15% of themarket that is um sort of like smallgroups these are still sort of smbs itmight be five therapists who have bandedtogether or 10 therapists or 20therapists that have banded together butvery much still operating like a a smallbusiness um and then there's about fiveor 10% of the market that has been sortof like professionalized um most ofthose are not within health systems orhospitals or academic medical centersthere's certainly some but most of thoseactually now are um Tech enabledcompanies that have typically eitherraised some Venture Capital money orsome private Equity money and have donesome to sort of like platform play orrollup play and are sort of aggregatingtherapists um and trying to to alsoimprove access or quality or orsomethingelse well I want to come back in aminuteto just from the the business and theentrepreneurial aspect of what you'redoing like how is it that you go tomarket in a in a sort of a situationlike this because it's very differentthan many or most uh of the healthcarecompanies that um you know certainly wework with but I want to talk a littlebit more about first like what is itthat you're actually doing and there'syou know there are companies out therethat are harnessing Ai and in a sensethat you know if not replacing thetherapists is kind of doing a lot of thework that they would otherwise do andthen there's your company which is Ithink not doing that and that you'remore focused on enabling and empoweringtherapist and I want to talkabout one why you took that approach andthen um let's talk about what it is thatyou're doing yeah yeah one of thethere's a bunch of ways to think aboutwhat we do but I think the the easiestespecially for someone brand new is isalmost think of blueprint as a co-pilotfor a therapist an AI co-pilot for atherapist um and so we sit alongside thetherapist we view ourselves as someonewho supports and backs up the therapistor like their sidekick um and I thinkthat is very there there's almost twoschools of thought within Ai and anyindustry you look are you um sort ofreplacing the person and the workthey're doing and achieving some similarlevel of outcome or better outcome orcheaper outcome or what have you or areyou more the co-pilot where you'resupporting the person making them moreproductive making them more efficientmaking them more effective whatever itmight be we're very much in that thatlatter camp and sort of always have beenjust in terms of the the nature of howwe got started the way we even describeourselves to um to to to to therapistsis really a tool to enable them rightand so um we we do that there's sort oflike two umbrella lenses we do thatnumber one is efficiency number two isEffectiveness um and so we have twoproducts uh one product in Marketanother product coming uh hopefully inthe next few weeks uh by by end ofSeptember um the first is really focusedon helping to automate documentation sohow do we um take the thing thattherapists hate typically the most it'ssort of like almost always at the top ofthe list of things therapists hate themost which is the paperwork they have todo um and and how do we use AI to toautomate that I can talk more about howwe do that um and then the secondproduct we're launching um reallyfocuses on um serving up insights andsuggestions and guidance before asession starts during a session andafter a session um both based on theinsights we've we've garnered fromprevious sessions but also based oninput from the from the client orpatient maybe between sessions sopulling in data uh from from all sortsof places But ultimately with thepurpose of giving that therapist moredata you a really easy to understand anddigest and and uh and and and reallyactionable way um so that they can uh dowhat they need to do but but uh thetechnology again is there to supportthem so I can talk a little bit moreabout that so so you you know one of thethings that you do is is like notetaking and and that saves the therapistI think a ton of timeevery week and and so break it down alittle bit in terms of how you're whatwhat is that H how are you collectingthe data that you're then analyzing howare you analyzing it um to provide thesesorts of of insights and and be thatco-pilot to to help therapists kind ofoperate again more efficiently as wellas uh and actually would love for you tomaybe break that down a little bitbecause one is operating moreefficiently and we you we see lots ofhealthcare companies that are you knowthere's lots of scribe companies of onesort or another that sit in aphysician's office in one way you knowor another and they're listening andthey and they do documentation or thingslike that um and then there's thequality piece which I I was sort of howyou got started in this of looking atyou know how to uh I can't remember thewords you just used because my brainisn't working but a couple minutes agoabout you know measurement based care orsomething like like that that that um uhthat's sort of making it easier and morepossible for more therapists to usethese kind of evidence-based approachesand and really being data driven so ifyou kind of think about it in terms ofthat efficiency play and then that thatefficacy play um you know go a littlebit deeper into what it is that you'redoing and how you're doing it yeah forsure um well first off like it's it'svery much efficiency first so one of thethe core realizations during the call itlike fiveyear Journey before I evenstarted the company of just likeimmersing myself in the space was thisrealization that therapists areextremely busy so are so are allHealthcare professionals but buttherapists included are extremely busyum especially when you think about sortof the the crisis from the lens ofaccess and even supply and demand rightlike they are very much in demand and sothus they're very much in back-to-backsessions all day every day um they maybehave five or 10 minutes in betweensessions and then they're task with allsorts of documentation work that has tohappen and it typically today it happensafter hours or on nights or weekends umand so um that causes a bunch of ofburnout so it's very much it's very muchefficiency first to then create thespace for quality but the way our ournotetaker product works um a therapistclicks record in our portal we thenrecord the duration of that um therapyconversation that that therapy sessionthat audio then gets sent to our systsystem we use AI to transcribe it and tosummarize it and ultimately to generatea clinical note um and there's a wholebunch of layers there including like theaudio's autod deleted and we never storeit um to to sort of really keep privacyand and data security top of mind butultimately they get the output of this30 seconds or 60 seconds after this uhtherapy session concludes they get thisreally accurate really high qualityreally compliant um clinical notewhether that be an intake note orprogress note whatever the situation isfor for their needsum it's like I said it's really accurateand so they may make a couple edits butmost people don't even need to so theyreview it make sure it looks good andthen either they've got a directintegration into their EHR or they cancopy and paste it uh and so it's anotherone or two clicks and and away they goand so if you just think about theimpact this has there's a there's abunch of ways to look at it but one ofthe the um the data points that we um weask in a bunch of surveys is when areyou completing your progress notes andbefore blueprint gets involved it'soften in at the end of the day or at theend of the week or on weekends orwhenever I can and then you compare thatto once they've started using blueprintand adopting blueprint and it's almostalways at the end of the session it goesfrom something that took 5 10 15 20minutes and thus they weren't able toeven complete in between the session tonow it takes 90 seconds maybe reviewedit copy paste boom they're done and sothen the end of the day comes and andthey can go home and they can spend timewith their husband or wife and theydon't have to catch up on all theirnotes and then do it again all the nextday and this sort of queue builds up andso um so that's how the notetakerproducts works and presumably the notesare better if you could do it right awayI mean I know if I try to wait until theend of the week to take notes on themeetings I had during the week like it'sa bunch of garbage so presumably it'sbetter quality information that getsrecorded right better qualityinformation and the way we've trainedour models is part of the purpose ofthese notes is not just for their ownbenefit but really like the clinicalnote is also for the sort ofdocumentation purpose and and to be incompliance and so we've sort of trainedthe model with that too so it'sdefinitely a better note from thatperspective the other interesting thingthat we actually sort of stumbl intothis but it's feedback we hear now allall day is now that I know I've got thisnotetaker and blueprint has my back withnotes I don't have to worry about typingor writing down notes I can actuallyjust focus on my patient um and so it'sthis like freeing thing also I I thinkwe haven't done any research on this butI have a hunch that that actually doestrickle into quality you're able todeliver higher quality care as a resultbecause you're listening and hearing andfocusing on your patient um because thisthing sort of has has your back in themeantime yeah I would think I meanintuitively it makes sense so I'mwilling to go I'm willing to go withthat uh and um have you run into issumean you said you you the audio doesn'tget stored it just gets deleted rightaway and are there transcripts or therelike how is there anything there oryou've kind of worked through all thatand you know everybody you know everytherapist has notes in some systemanyway so so you're beyond that you'reyou're not create opening any other sortof doors relatedto uh security and of of data yeah Imean on the data security front I wouldsay we uh we had been in we we launchedthat product only about eight or ninemonths ago something like that and so wehave the um it's it's now sort of becomethe the centerpiece for us in many waysbut when we launched that we sort of hadthe I guess the hindsight and theforesight to know that like hey in inthis space and mental health care and inany space but in particular in mentalhealth care like the the privacy and thedata security aspect is is huge and nowwe're actually going to ask theseclinicians to open up their their fourwalls or their virtual four walls andsort of let us in and and let thistechnology in and and not just let us inbut actually let us listen to thecontent of a session so it's it's a bigask and that is like the number onething we focus on now is how do we buildtrust through this interface but we wehad the foresight and the hindsight toreally focus on building uh privacy andSecurity in from day one both from atechnical standpoint and the encryptionand the Hippa and the Saku and all thatstuff but also um some of the featureswe built in like the recording's gone soit it doesn't even exist and that posessome challenges up FR but we sort of hadthe the the ability to sort of step backand do that um because we felt likewould be really important and andultimately the bre the best product herewill win but part of that means the mostsecure the most trusted uh the mostprivate given the the nature of theproduct um there's all sorts of like umodds and ends in terms of uh challengesand difficulties when it comes to umcapturing audio and transcribing thataccurately and using that to summarizeand generate a a really good note we'vegotten really good at it there's stillsort of a never- ending chase down ofthose things cuz you're deal with thereal world and different microphones andcomputers and rooms and and all sorts ofstuff but um we've gotten pretty good uhby now we've we've nowdone last week we crossed 12 millionminutes uh of recorded sessions uh inthe last six months or so so uh more togo but but we're definitely uh on ourway right so a few followup questionsfrom that so one is just do patientsthere must be some percentage ofpatients that freak out when they findout out that they're being recorded likewhat what does that look like yeahthere's definitely some but less than wethought and less than our customersthought and less than you'd probablyexpect um we don't measure it butanecdotally it's what we hear is it'syou know probably to the order ofmagnitude of like 5 to 10% of patientswho are just not comfortable forwhatever reason um and so we have a wehave a solution for that which is thetherapist at the end of the session caninstead of recording it just dictate asummary so they talk to our our our tooland explain the contents of that sessionit's still fresh in their head for themost part and they can still get apretty good note as a result um but it'syou know five or 10% and we have sort ofsome of the consent process that werecommend um therapists do built intothe product to try and make that reallyeasy as well yeah do the patients everwant to hear it like do yeah can't youcan't do that right because you're notstoring the so we do we do generate asummary for both clinician and patienttoday we leave it up to the clinician toshare it with the patient um can bereally valuable because a I think it uhit gives them some skin in the game ofyou know why give consent to do thisthing Beyond just helping my myclinician um but uh but B it's it'spowerful just just like a just like thetherapist remembering what you coveredlast week is hard for any of us we'reall busy and and sort of takes time toremember that that contextso andthen this is probably a dumb questionbut you know there's so manyuh tools out there in sort of in thehealthc care world that listen inon uh on on conversations that patientsare having with their primary carephysician or with their specialistthere's tools that listen inon on you know this this uh sessionright here and you know come up with thetranscript afterwards and like whatit what is special about what you'rewhat you've built compared to all theseother you know tool like why do we needanother one of those yeah I think fromfrom the beginning of our company one ofthe sort of core thesis Theses was uhtherapists need and deservepurpose-built software there really hashas not been many if any pieces ofsoftware designed specifically for thetherapist specifically to help them dotheir job better however you define thatbut like specifically for them um and soI think uh that's sort of been ourbelief from day one with respect toscribes there's a bunch of other AIscribes even like human scribes are athing not for therapists typically butfor other healthc Care Professionals umand so when we think about sort ofwhy why us and why now and why we fit inand why why do we even need to do thisright um there's a few reasons numberone therapists and their workflows areare very unique most of the other AIscribe companies in the in the spacesome of the ones who have raised lotsand lots of money they're focused onGeneral Healthcare almost likehorizontal across Healthcare and thusvery focused on health systems andhospitals and academic medical centersand if you think about um the theworkflows first of a physician withinone of those Health Care uhorganizations versus the workflow of atherapist are very very different one ofthe most sort of concrete ways to to seethe difference is a uh the averagetherapy appointments 50 55 minutes longthe average physician appointment isabout 15 or 17 minutes long somethinglike that and then all the intricaciesthat go along with that the other thingis the documentation needs are very veryunique and so Physicians can prescribemedications and so um they obviouslytypically want their documentation toincorporate medications as well as abunch of other variables like previousmedications and maybe allergies andmedication history and all sorts ofstuff that relate to medicationstherapists on the other hand they don'tprescribe medication and so theyspecifically need documentation that isum quote unquote non-medical um to sortof cover the types of interventions thatthat they're doing and they're providingand and the impact of those um and thenI think the third piece is just the themarket stuff that we talked aboutearlier the go to market uh to to sortof reach most of healthcare call it isgoing to look very different becausemost of healthcare does live now withinhospitals Health Systems AMC's and uhmental health you know is is just verydifferent and so um I I think without avertically specific or purpose-built umtool for therapists they will sort ofonce again get left behind in some ofthese revolutions and and we're reallydetermined to to to make that uh makethat change and and so thus we go we gosort of very deep vertically withintherapy we don't we don't sort of gooutside of of the the walls of mentalhealth we'll Veer a little bit outsideof just therapist but but pretty prettystraight shot towards therapists and Ithink that's how we're unique anddifferent and and we don't stand achance if you comp paros versus one ofthose other scribes when when it's acardiologist but we win almost everytime when it's a therapist using it interms of the the type of documentationand the workflow and allthat okay so you've got this scribe yougot 12 million minutes for it's goingwhat so you're creating these notes umbut then you're I interrupted you awhile back because you were going totalk I think about then what you do withthat and how it is that you're you'renot just saving the therapist's time interms of the documentation but you'realso layering in a bunch of intelligencethat provides in information andinsights to the therapists at certaintimes is that am I exactly yeah so oneof the beautiful Parts about the Scribefeature set or product is it veryquickly builds this daily habit wheretherapists once they hear about us andsign up for a free account and andhopefully then convert to a pat accountand start using this they they veryquickly adopt to using this every singleday with every single one of theirpatients or clients during every singleone of their sessions and so that sortof creates this surface area for us togo deeper and the the first place we'regoing deeper is how do we layer bothbefore a session starts and after asession concludes um helpful insightshelpful suggestions helpfulrecommendations in certain cases uhbased on the contents of the sessionthat we had previously acquired andsummarized and and generated a note forso there's sort of like two very clearuse cases the first is what we callpression prep so this is right before asession starts you get like a prep sheetas a therapist and it's bullet pointsand you can see it's some clinical andsome uh sort of non-clinical sonon-clinical things are um who thisperson is that you're seeing and maybethings like what their their kids namesare what their husband or wife's name isum and then you get all the way down tohey here's their treatment plan here'sthe goals you set out to to um to tomake progress on on their treatment planhere's their latest clinical assessmentthat shows their progress towards thosegoals and it gives you places to sort ofreally dig in um because again thinkabout the the life of a therapistthey've got maybe three four five sixminutes in between a session to uh to toprepare and get up to speed and they'regoing to the bathroom they're getting aquick bite to eat they're sort ofde-stressing and then reamping up and sothis is sort of that tool to help themget started um and then similarly postsession we will help them with sort ofthe takeaways and the action items andthat might be assigning a specificclinical assessment or hey you talkedabout um sleep as sort of a core thingthat you want this this client to workon maybe you want to assign them aTracker that can help them keep track oftheir their sleep and and log that outso that we can discuss it at the nextsession things likethatso this is a little bit of a tangent butI what you just described is you knowI'm obviously I'm not a therapist I havea lot of meetings with people I thatwould be amazing if I could like youknow next time I meet with you somethingpops up and it's like hey reminderhere's you know Danny's personalwhatever you know kids and here's thename of his dog and the last time youmet you talked about XYZ and here's someprompts for how to pick up and continuethe conversation or something likethat you know I think I think about likeI my haircut recently somehow she I I'veknown her for a very long time but someshe you know she always she knows my dogand like she remembers all this stuffand I think she just has a really goodmemory but you know this this conceptthat you'redescribing could have applications youknow beyond just mental health is isthat again it's probably a tangent butdo you have aspirations or do you seethis com your company being able toextend into other areas or is the arethe tools and the systems and everythingthat you've built really dependent andsort of focused on therapy I thinkthere's I think there's room forInnovation outside of therapy and andsort of like key learnings that we'relearning to sort of transpire overhowever for us as a company we'restaying incredibly focused on on mentalhealth and mental health professionalsum I think there's a ton of opportunitythere and and we want to go sort of deepon that space and add additionalproducts and capabilities over time thatsort of serve the mental healthprofessional to let them do their bestwork um but I think we draw inspirationfrom day-to-day conversations andday-to-day um sort of interactions likeyou described because um I I sort ofsaid earlier there there's a lot wedon't know in the space in terms of whatdrives a high quality outcome there's alot of people thinking about that andworking on that one of the the things wedo know is that uh at least based on thethe research out today the number onepredictor of a positive outcome isTherapeutic Alliance which sort of saidsimply as the strength of therelationship between a therapist andtheir their client or patient so youthink about some of the stuff youmentioned like remembering your dog'sname like that that actually does helpand it actually can improve outcomes butagain for us sort of like reallybuilding and designing for the therapistuse case is is how we'll sort of likeapply that and I think um that's yeahthat's just our our Focus the brandwe're buildinghow so what so getting back on tracksorry about my tangent but what umthe the information the content thatyou're providing to the therapist toimprove the quality of their theinteractions and the sessions that theyhave with their patients um what elseare you providing beyond that the sortof personal recap uh personal stuff theRecaps the you've got prompts like ithow deep does that go and and how do youfeel like what where you are todaycompares to if you think back six yearsand the kind of insight that was drivingyou to start the company that there'sjust this huge variability in in qualityand efficacy of care yeah where do youwhere where are you in that Journeytoday yeah well maybe I'll go in reverseorder so when we got started it was allabout collecting data from from patientsin betweenvisits um and that sort of came in inthe form of clinical assessment socapturing symptoms and and symptomseverity typically throughquestionnaires that we would send themremotely and automatically as well asthrough um this concept in therapycalled sort of worksheets or homeworkexercise that um again similarly oursort of client or patient inputedinformation specific to their treatmentand specific to their treatment planthat a therapist is sort of asking themto do or complete or share or log insome way so we would go out and throughour uh our mobile app and our our webapp and text and email we wouldautomatically go and collect thisinformation we would serve it up to theclinician at the next visit try and makeit really easy to understand and act onand and and use in some way shape orform during that next session and wemade good Headway here but what werealized pretty quickly well maybe notpretty quickly maybe maybe it took us afew years is that uh therapists arereally really busy and so they didn'teven have the head space to think aboutthis new thing even though they weremotivated to try and do whatever waswithin their their power and whateverwas possible to try and um help thepatient or client that they're treatingand deliver the best outcome likethey're genuinely amazing people and andmotivated to do that but they're just sounderwater and typically one of thedriving factors was was documentation sothat is sort of like almost think oflike we're on this journey and we tookthis pivot because it was actually goingto let us create the space to then goand and allow people to invest in inthis in this sort of new way of ofpracticing um um so one of the benefitsof that is over the first call it threeor four years we built out this reallyrobust um we call it like a clinicalContent Library so this is thousands ofHighly curated um but also pretty broadevidence-based um clinical assessmentshomework assignments symptom trackersand now also therapeutic intervention sothese are like sort of the the keycomponents of what an evidence-basedtherapist will will do before duringafter between a session with theirpatients they're like the sort of thethings that drive outcomes or drivechange or drive results um whateverthose results may be and so we have thisreally robust Content Library that webuilt up what we're now able to do issurface up that content to the rightclinician at the right time so they candeliver the right care and it's muchmore of a personalized and almost likebite-sized experience because again umtherapists are busy but also so most ofthem weren't trained in all of thisstuff most of them are not um superanalytical or data driven inherentlyagain they're motivated to want todeliver the best possible care but howwe surface this stuff up to them isreally important and now um both withthe Scribe product and then also with AIand the capabilities today um we canactually do that so that's pretty prettyexciting again we're launching thatproduct in in a few weeks uh morebroadly there's a a small Alpha cohortof users using it today but we thinkthere's um a lot that we can pull fromthe early days but apply in a muchdifferent way thanks to large languagemodels and and other AI methodstoday and is the the 12 million minutesthat you'veuh I don't know if the right word istranscribed or that you know that sortof flowed through the Subscribe productis some of that Content Library that youmentioned derivedfrom those minutes and that data or willit be as you go and andpresumably at some point I don't don'tknow whether it's 12 million or 100million or a billion I don't know whereit needs to be but at somepoint theoretically you're going to haveso much data and also longitudinal datapresumably about patient progress andand what the interventions were what thetype of counseling was or the specificsuggestions or things and which whatworked and what didn't is that all stuffthat youare able tocapture from a obviously from atechnical point of view you can captureall that but you know obviously you'redealing with with some very sensitivedata and information so to to whatextent are you able to capture that youknow build a system that learns from itand then use that to inform and and keepyou know getting smarter about howyou're helping and empowering therapiststo to just get better more better andbetter results yeah so we we sort ofview ourselves as of stewards of thedata like really it's the the clinicianor the the the practice that they workfor and and the patient jointly sort oflike their data so we're sort ofstewards of the data they can keep theirdata on blueprint not the recordingthat's sort of by design we we we wipethat but the transcription and thesummaries that we generate bothclinician and and patient facing andthen the clinical note and so there's abunch of valuable information there theycan turn those off they can delete themum most people keep them because there'sa whole set of features that um thatsort of come along with keeping them andso as we look towards the future andsome of the interesting things we coulddo I think it's about giving people areason to keep that data on there wedon't really want that data just fordata's sake but if we can um give them areally comping reason to to use thatdata uh for their own benefit or fortheir patients benefit what we see todayis is most people are are fine keepingthat data on platform so long as we'vesort of built the appropriate level oftrust up front um so uh there's a lotthat we're thinking about whether it bethe the content or deciphering theinterventions or even like there's somereally interesting like research thatcould probably be plucked out of thisthinking about what drives the bestoutcomes at scale and so um all ofthat's on the table for sure over thelong term I think there's a path for alot of that um and and I hope we can getthere it's exciting veryexcitingum do you uh I just lost my train ofthought because I it's so interesting ifyou're able to generate enough data andand use it and really apply it to adisciplinethatum you know where that hasn't happenedas much as as some other as some otherdisciplines exactly umuh when you first started the companythere I mean there was artificialintelligence but not like there is todaylike a a verydifferent world today andat at what point didyou you know did it sort of hit you thatthe tools that are becomingavailable I can represent kind of adramatic step change in the company andthe capabilities and and what what didthat Journey looklike yeah I mean we were I was thinkingabout more machine learning and sort ofthe predictive aspects of artificialintelligence from the very beginning butit was very different in how we thoughtwe'd apply it just because always fromday one there was this data elementright we hadn't really done much thereother than think about how we're goingto structure the data and think about itas a core asset that we're building upthat we can then use for various reasonsso I think the the light bulb reallywent on on the sort of application andand use case like many other people whenopen AI released chat GPT and likeeveryone sort of experienced this liketotally new really powerfulmindbending um experience um and so westarted to I don't remember exactly whenthat was I think late 2022 early 2023 westarted to investigate and and and evenincorporate really small bits of that inour product before we made this sort ofstepwise change or launch um and I thinkto ourbenefit so too did therapists like theywere starting to explore this in theirpersonal lives I mean everyone had beenexposed it seems like to to chat GPT orsome derivative solution uh in some wayum and their numbers are sort ofmindboggling and so that actually helpedbecause then when we were coming to thetherapist with this AI solution they'relike oh yeah I understand AI andactually now like a lot of them are outactively seeking AI to help them intheir jobs some for documentation somefor whole other purposes um and I thinkall of that is thanks to some of thelike consumer Mass Market almost likeadoption or even exposure maybe just ofof AI and and the benefits and uhbreaking down maybe some of the some notall of the um of the fear around Ai andthe future of of technologyso got ithow have you been you've talked a lotabout outcomes and sort of danced aroundit in different ways have you been abletomeasure or quantify you know you canquantify on the efficiency side it savesfive or 10 or 15 however many hours ofyou know documentation and and you couldprobablyquantify it probably wouldn't be thathard to quantify like pre-meeting prepmaybe you already have done it but youknow it saves you X amount of timepreparing on the quality side are youable toquantify outcomesimprovements with blueprint compared towithout blueprint yeah we've done somecase studies it's definitely on our roadmap to sort of do more broadscale widerpeer reviewed type of research anddefinitely with where we're going it'sit's a key part of that road map but umsort of in in the prescribe day we did abunch of case studies with customerswhere we had the opportunity during sortof an implementation period where wecould sort of run this almost doubleblind where there was some cohort of uhof clinicians who were adopting andimplementing and using uh blueprint andthe advocacy really came from thisprocess of measurement based care whichhas been pretty well studied but butmeasuring it hey how good is blueprintat doing that um and then some othercohort were in the in the control andthey were waiting and they they wouldget access later but they were secondand we could sort of measure outome soit's not perfect cuz it's not looking atthe same clinician doing it or not doingit um but when we did that I think thethe largest case study we ran which wasacross I want to say 500 or so patientsover the course of a couple months wesaw about a 40% um increase in speed ingetting sort of a predefined level ofresponse so some level of response inthe treatment that a therapist was doingbut actually getting there much muchfaster and if you think back to thetrial and error this data essentially wethink helped them go through that trialand error process figure out some typeof intervention or treatment plan thatthat would start to help them makeprogress um and there's other casestudies we did that looked at differentthings but that was always one that wasreally Stark which is 40 I think it was44% quicker treatment response when youuse a tool like blueprint um which iswhich is largely what a lot of themeasurement based care research whichhas been around for something like 20years and there's tons and tons ofstudies on it showed but now actuallyseeing in a in a real world settingversus just in a research setting is isalso pretty cool say more about that44%increase in the or decrease I guess intimeresponse say I mean that I mean to anuntrained year that sounds prettydramatic like what yeah that a more yeahyeah so 44% quicker treatment responsewhich means um it's it's all measured bythese clinical assessments or clinicalSCso reaching a a specific predefined Ican't remember what the specifics wereon it but some predefined change insymptom severity and so let's just sayit's uh we want to achieve a 10-pointchange on on a depression scale andwe're going to Define that as treatmentresponse we're responding to thetreatment we're not yet in fullremission as as it's defined but heythere's some initial response that washappening much earlier on in thattreatment journey and so again if youthink back to sort of the the es and theflows and the trial and error of ofmental health and mental health carelike that can be really significant umnot just in the end all outcome but alsomaking sure someone gets there quickerum you know can can save lives and we wehave had instances sort of otherinstances where because we're capturingthis information from the patient in uhin in unique ways we can get thatinformation to the provider and and theprovider more than one provider has toldus uh this has helped keep a patientalive in certain cases so it's it'sreally about collecting that informationand then getting it to the provider andletting them do their thing they'rereally well trained and really smart anduh it's just about having access to thisinformation in certain cases that caninfluence in a bunch of different ways Imean I'm sure there's more work to doand more research but is it is that alsopoint to a a direction where insurancecompanies would be interested in payingI mean that could save a lot of money ifthere's a 44 youknow you know yeah somebody's got allthis stuff so I that's definitely that'sdefinitely the goal I think um I wouldsay three four years ago we thought thatchange would happen quicker um but we'reencouraged by what's happening in thelast call it 12 months um and I thinkwe're seeing you know the insurancecompanies are are very large companiesso inherently they just like it takestime for the stuff to work through thesystem but I think um we're seeing morechange and more urgency and we'retalking to a number of them now to tryand um structure different incentivesand programs and and we're really sortof just the middleman to help make thisprocess easier but they're now sort offully bought into this as a thing thatimproves outcomes and in some ways mostimportantly to them saves them uh savesthem dollars which sort of moves theneedle forthem I think it's changing now in termsof like their uh willingness toprioritize something like this valuebased care specifically in in BehavioralHealth in part because a lot of thecosts have gone up in the last fiveyears um as uh utilization has gone upand part of that is because we actuallyhave made a lot of good progress on theaccess front part of that is some of theum implications of covid and the demandfor and and the need for mental healthcare has gone way up and now sort of ina lag period the payers are looking attheir you know 2022 or 2023 costs andall of a sudden Behavioral Health and inparticular outpatient Behavioral Healthwhich is where most of the the carehappens um is is has has entered the youknow top five or top three or top 10it's got the eyeballs now and so that'sreally exciting because I do think umfor us to see really longlastingum change at the the scale that I thinkwe all want like obviously the payershave to be involved in this in some wayshape or form to to drive outcomes andand appropriately incentivize the rightoutcomes so yeah all right I wantan to Iwant to ask you about you know in theabsence of of payersum you know just how just from anentrepreneurial business point of viewhow you go to market with something likethis but before I do that there's abunch of people who've asked questionsrelated to the llm that you're using sojust can you just describe I know youdidn't build your own llm and I'm veryhappy that you didn't because me tooprobably not the best use of resourcesbut like what are you using and and howdo you train it differently than youknow what comes off the shelf and andhow C is it yeah um we use a combinationof a couple both open Ai and anthropicand some of their different models andum the way I think about it is it's likesort of this pipeline um we also usedifferent tools to help withtranscriptionum which is not really llms but sort ofin that in that sphere so we think of itas this pipeline um and the pipelinereally is focused on um the the end userfor us so just just maybe to break itdown a little bit further so wetranscribe session that's prettystraightforward uh you just want it tobe really accurate and that sort ofserves as the ingredients for everythingto come but once we do that we generatea few different summaries from thattranscription one of them is a summaryfor the clinician one of them is asummary for the patient we also generatea couple other summaries from the theViewpoint of different um stakeholdersso in particular one we do is a summaryas if you were an auditor so I'm anauditor and I'm reviewing this thistranscript what's my sort of summary andopinion um and then we use use all thosesummaries to ultimately generate a noteand we have these two agents sort ofworking in tandem one is generating anote to the uh to the liking of theclinician so they've inputed through ourinterface lots of preferences weunderstand some of the changes they'vemade to previous notes we've generatedfor them and we we track all of that uhwhere they're making edits whattemplates they're using what sectionsthey're using Etc so one one version ofthe note is like hey here's the bestpossible note from the clinicianperspective the other is playing the ofan auditor and looking at oh this note'sout of compliance here it's out ofcompliance there it's in compliancethere and these two things sort of workum in tandem almost imagine like twopeople having a conversation andultimately bringing the best of bothparts and then presenting that throughthe interface um to the clinician sothere's all sorts of like fine-tuningand training and uh and prompting andand and workflow implications that gointo it um it's funny it sounds likesort of simple when you think of it ohwe just transcribe it we throw it intochat GP in a way we go and that can getyou some of the way there but to likereally do this at scale and do it wellit's it's uh intricate um I wish it waseasier but it's it's challenging um andthere's a whole bunch of other sort ofimplications that we think about tooyeah it doesn't sound simple to meanymore I mean not that it did to beginwith but it certainly doesn't we want itto sound really really simple when wedescribe how it works right because it'slike three click and you have thismagicalsolution how do you just last point onthis it like you know one of theconcerns about chat GPT and open a isthat anything you put in there goes intotheir system and presumably there's someextra level of sensitivity around thedata that you are generating so how doyou manage that yeah so we're on anEnterprise contract with all of thesevendors and so as part of that theydon't they don't train on any of the thedata that we send with them we also do abunch of stuff on our end to do thingslike redact Phi before we send it wehave baas with all of them too but justas like an extra layer we redact andthen we'll sometimes reinsert dependingon the the need like for example if wewant to include a a client's name in thenote well we'll we'll redact that beforewe send from the transcript and thenwe'll reinsert it on our end because weknow who that client is in our system umso there's all sorts we we sort of tryand build a firewall but we also havepretty deep um Partnerships andrelationships now with some of thesecompaniesum and and they've structured it in away to sort of meet the exact samepotential problem that that you'recalling out I think like the biggerproblem than the like fundamentaltechnical how it works is really justthe perception and the trust becausemost people don't know that right andand most people will even if that's thetruth they'll assume something else andso it's really about designing thisexperience in a way that builds trustover time we can't expect them to shareeverything and open up although somepeople do open up their their practiceand all their patients right out of thegate um but how do we do that over timeuh incrementally to sort of continuebuilding thattrust got it all right we don't have alot of time left but I I wna I I find itreally interesting because you know mostof the healthcare companies we work withare you know really it's a it's a muchmore of aB2B sale and and you know environmentthan what you're dealing with I meyou're trying to sell I think the sevenor800,000 mostlyindividualpractitioners is this where yourbackground in you know consumer fashionand safety uh kind of really helps youor how do you go to market withsomething like that yeah F funny enoughI I think it it does in a little wayit's not like that was planned out oranything but we we are a Healthcarecompany but in especially in terms whereI go to market we look more like a asort of like SMB B2B company or even a ab Toc company sometimes we use the termprosumer um internally as like what ouruh sort of motion is with respect to goto market so we are really reallyfocused on what we call the practitionerso it's the therapist in most cases butany practitioner that's who we'remarketing to that's who we're speakingto that's who we're designing for on ourwebsite and um and the way we reachthose is primarily through inbound so wedo a bunch of advertising and marketingand organic and and sort of Word ofMouth but we're always thinking aboutthe practitioner um and that's notbecause we don't want to reach theorganization that employs a thousand ofthose practitioners it's just thatthat's the biggest bang for the buck andthat is really how we can have ourmessaging be most clear and and uh andpure and so what ends up happening isthose practitioners hear about us theycome to our website they sign up it'slargely self-served especially for thethe individual practitioners it's it'sentirely self-served they sign up theycan um record their first session theycan see their first note they get fivefree notes out of the gate if and whenthey're ready they can upgrade to a paidplan and away they go and so most of ourcustomers that's how they interact umwhat's interesting is about 25% of thesignups we get are people who are partof a a group either small medium orlarge and so we actually through thatprocess of marketing to the practitionerbuild this bottomup strategy as wellwhere now we have because a lot of themare 1099s Within These groups theyactually do have some leeway to use thetools that they want for their job andso we're able to uh reach some of thoseorganizations in a bottomup way and thatsort of serves as signal for our salesteam to then go and reach out to TheClinical Director at XYZ because heythey've actually got six therapists attheir company using blueprint everysingle day some of them are even payingfor it on their own credit card and soit's like warm leads for us on thatfront and then we go top down but umreally that combination and sort of thepractitioner focused go to market is isuh how we think aboutit well so where can listeners uh go tolearn more about blueprint yeah so umour website blueprint dhealthdocomo uh relatively active on LinkedInand Instagram and Facebook and all allthe other channels you can also email medirectly uh my emails Danny blueprintdhealth tocom um and yeah hopefully thiswas enjoying I know I sure enjoyed it umbut would love to to chat with anyonewho uh who wants to go a littledeeper well thank thank you so muchreally appreciate it uh very muchenjoyed the conversation I it'sfascinating what you're building andwish you the best of luck as youcontinue on this uh journey to everyoneelse who joined if you like thisconversation I'll be talking with agentleman named om Golan tomorrow abouthe's also in the uh AI Mental HealthCare space he's building a notfor-profit technology company called mywhatif which is using AI to help peopleget through PTSD and other forms of ofuh trauma you can learn about that signup for it learn about any uh of ourother

      <td>thank you thank you so much uh andwelcome nice to see so many so many ononline here so I'm going to talk alittle bit about how how I look at therole of of AI in mental health promotionand uh I'm going to focus um more on onthe applications in working working lifethan than the Generalapplication uh but before I get I getstarted with that I I I would as abackground tell a little bit little bitabout the the place I'm working and andand what angles we have with with mentalhealth and uh and andworkability so IL marinen is one of theone of the three three major Pensionfunds uh in Finland we take care of theearnings related the work pensions ofmore than 1 1.1 million people so uh wehave a mandatory mandatory uh pensioninsurance that that each company has totake for their for their um employees isand uh we are one of the one of thecompanies handling handling these theseinsurances there's a couple of couple offigures so so we're almost 600 peopleworking here we take care of of uh in ifyou if you count them together uh130,000 companies so both both companiesand and single entrepreneurs and uh wehave about 60 billion 60 billion eurosin Pension funds that that we managehowever I don't work with that money butI help with the uh work disability riskfor client organizations and this is howsome of the some of the areas that weworking so uh strategic work abilitymanagement occupationalRehabilitation physical factors andeconomics Occupational Health Care andbest practices there data and KnowledgeManagement psychosocial factors andmental health and and those two otherthe ones ones I focus on mainly uh alsoI do a little bit of dabbling in in dataKnowledge Management due to due tohaving uh gotten a degree in in computerscience aswell so this is this is what I work withand then if we go to the need and theuses of AI to promote mental health inin workplaces there are a couple ofcouple of figures that are often oftenrepeated so this is the statistics fromfrom the uh from Kella the thegovernmentuh Institute for pensions uh who alsokeep statistics of of sick leaves andsickness absences because the companiesthe employers uh get money from fromfrom from from the sick leaves that theemployees take so uh almost 50,000persons last year received SE leaveswith uh anxiety related diagnosis so wesee the the mentalhealth main mental health categoriesthat that are shown here and and thetime series for those so we havedepression it was on the rise for quitea long time but that that has now now acouple of years since broken but umanxiety disorders have have increased uhover double in in in the last in thelast eight eight eight nine years uhpersonally I think one reason for thisis that people seek help uh earlier thanthey did before so they start seekinghelp already when they are feelinganxious and and not uh when all alltheir energy is spent and they they endup with with depression so there's quitea lot of uh like short-term uhworkability issues related to mentalhealth uh but this is the other figureand this is the disability pensions andthis is now incidence rate so so it's uhthe portion of the workforce that getget disability pensions and and if youlook at the amount of Pensions it lookit looks a little bit different but ifyou look at the incidence rate here umthe dark blue one is is uhmusculoskeletal disorders and and uh anduh the light blue one is is mental andbehavioral disorders so so here we seethat the trend trend is not not thatmuch rising Rising at the moment againthis is not the whole truth applicationsfor uh disability pensions as for mentalhealth reasons especially from Youngworkers are are on the rise so sothere's this kind of phenomenon but umit's too early to say that that uh thatthe incident rates for the pensions areare getting out of hand so this is oneof the I think more positivenews Okay so the way I look at it uh theuse cases for AI in promoting mentalhealth um are are as as follows um oneis is how we detect and predict mentalhealth problems and and as I looked atthe uh the other speakers uh titles forthis this is something that that we aregoing to hear more about and and this issomething that I'm very very interestedto hear about uh another one is to uhthink about how to support the decisionsfor choosing an effective interventionso once we have sensed predicteddetected that okay here's a potentialmental health problem what would be thecorrect uh level of support or mode ofsupport for for this person one umcompany in Finland that I'm actually alittle bit little bit involved in uhcalled formulator does exactly this sowhat what they what they are doing is uhis that they have a tool tool that helpsyou kindof verbalize and and and and uh organizethe thoughts relating to the problem sothen when you go and see a professionalyou have you have it kind of thought outuh or already uh another quite obviousone and and this is one that that thereare many many applications carrying outthe actual interventions one one of myfavorites for this is called wot it'sit's it's a chatbot that helps you withwith mental health issues uh it alsosends occasional cat videos and tellsstories about the toaster who is his orits colleague at the office so it's it'skind of fun it's it's it's worth tryingout uh and then we have uh thepossibility to kind of supportinterventions that that we have a tooltool that supports the intervention andone that I ran into I think this is thisis from the United States cheeseburgertherapy which in which uh untrainedpeople give other people uh therapysessions through a chat but but thenthere's an an AI in between that readsthe messages and then suggests that okaynow he said this you could suggest thiskind of approach or he's talking aboutsleeplessness you could try one of theseinterventions or uh they're talkingabout being self-destructive now youhave to send this information thatplease contact these these places sothis is Loosely based on on on on onwhat was published by by formulator inin U a whitepaper uh andthen um if we look at at at mentalhealth in in in the workplace then wecome to the the issue of Psychosocialfactors at work so the the factors thatare causing causing stress and this isthis is whatJohanna uh Johanna is probably going togoing to talk about a little bit morebut there are a couple of couple of kindof challenges in measuring thesepsychosocial factors so one is thatmeasurements usually happen in hindsightso we ask that have you been very busylast week or or have you felt stress orhave you had trouble trouble sleepinglately uh another one is that thequestioners and the service primarilythey tell us about the effect of thepsychosocial factors so so uh we get wehave questions like does the cooperationbetween teams in in your company workwell uh and that basicallytells I mean it can be a psychosocialfactor that it's not working well butthe reason why it's working well well ornot is is not that obvious or or thiskind of question that we have in in inthe service that that we provide ourclients with that I usually manage mytasks within normal working hour so thisis a sign of stress but this is not uhin such uh a psychosocialFactor uh then a major problem and andthis is something that I'm reallyeagerly looking forward to to what kindof solutions uh are emerging in thisarea is this measurements are basicallybased on experiences and opinions we askpeople that do you feel stressed we askpeople that do you have too much of aworkload we ask people that are your areyour goals uh clear or or unclear andand and what is related to this is thatthen we assume that every employee hasan equal amount of self-awareness so sothey kind of recognize that okay this isstressing me they are able to reflect itthat I'm feeling stressed because ofthis and that they are equally preparedand and kind of eager to voice thiscriticism to to to kind of raise theissues in the workplace uh in allsituations so if you have a company thatis planning layoffs and then you askpeople that that are you happy with thecompany and and and are you feelingstressed then uh I don't think everyonewill answer those those questionshonestlyokay uh and then if we look at look atthe thoughts like what do I think thatthat workplaces need to promote protectand and support mental health so I wastalking about like what are the possibleapplications that you can recognize theproblem you can uh help pick a solutionfor the problem you can implement thesolution or you can support support thesolution so what kind of issues uh do weneed need to kind of attend to and howwould AI help in help in this so onequite obvious is the risk identificationand management so so how do we bestrecognize the risks uh in the work thethe psychosocial factors how can wemanage it keep track of them keep keepkind of following up that what is whatis going on with with this with thisissue uh another one is is that do weidentify the resources that we have andcan we manage them so in in in thissense resources means things that thatpeople are happy with that help them tocope with the risks that help them tocope with the work so so how do weidentify what is working well why is itworking well and how do we keep track ofthat and keep it working working well sothis is one one of the questions that Isee that that theyi can can help with uhthen a bit more tricky one reflectionand sharedunderstanding so um usually the problemis not that we we don't recognize therisks or that we don't understand themuh I think everyone of us knows that toomuch workload with unclear goals and andtoo little contact with other people uhis usually not a very good recipe forfor promoting either well-doing or orwell-being in the workplace but but wedon't have the time to sit down and andand kind of reflect and and uhget to know this now one oh yeah andthen there's one one more uh and then avery important one because it's kind ofeasy to build uh an application that yougive some some data to and then it uhsuggests that you should be doing thisbut how do we get people to staymotivated H H how do we keep thecompanies motivated to kind of maintainthe good practices that that help withthe risks and also strengthen theresourcesthere's one one uh Finnish startup thatis is working with this reflection andshared understanding called uh ecologistwhich is kind of an interesting ideathat that that the their premise is thatthat the AI works as a kind ofconsultant or agent within theorganization so it can listen to theemployees and then it can make summariesand report back to the management andand so on and then it also also helpsthe helps the employees in in checkrelated questions and so on so there wasone one question um that was posedbefore before the webinar um and itasked that that can can AI replacepsychologists and uh so I was thinkingabout it and and I kind of tried to makea simple simple demonstration of thatthat I think on the surface level uh youcan get quite far so if we think aboutreflection as a therapeutic methodmethod reflection is is when someonedescribes a problem with you uhdescribes a problem to you not with youto to you and then you reflect it backthat is this what you were talking aboutor this is what I picked up or this isthis is what I heard and uh it seemsthat that large language models workquite well with this so there's a linkto the complete chat with the with theprompt I used this is this is the freeaccess uh GPT3.5 on on chat GPT that I used but butthe discussion went went went like thisthat that first uh the co I prompted itto be a coach not not a psychologist butsomeone that is here to support me in mywell-being in the workplace and how howto assist me so I posed a question thatI feel stressed and and I had given theThe Prompt that it should reflect backwhat I what I said so then thediscussion continues it asks about thereasons and then again it it it reflectsback back what I what I was what I wassaying here and and then ask me the howam I coping with the stress and I tellthat I'm not coping very very well I Ikeep um procrastinating and puttingthings off to the next next day and andand then it starts explaining this so Ithink that that when we have an issuewhere you kind of can recognize what itwhat is going on can verbalize what whatis going on and and need someone to tokind of help you find a little bit otherviewpoints then surprisingly well uh thelarge language model model seems to workwork with this but if you want to tolook at the whole whole um conversationthere's there's a link included in thepresentationmaterial but then I think think thebiggest challenge here is as we as withall kind of new technologies and and newnewapproaches is that that uh I don't seethe biggest challenges in building thetools as as it as you can see here thistook me about about 10 10 minutes tomake so some kind of trivial concept oror or lowlevel tool is is is quite easyto make but the main challenge is inmaintaining the motivation to to to kindof implement this that if this chatbotgives me some good good advice on how towork with the stress then that I keepmotivated in starting those thosemeasures and and and doing doing themand then the other one is is that thecompanies are able to kind of allocateenough resource ources and and thisusually means time to to actually changethings otherwise we will end up in in ina situation where um whereuh you kind of try to Outsource theproblem that that people's or employeesmental health is being challenged uh andthen uh the solution is to to kind oftry to solve it outside the organizationand and outside the work environment andand without changing the work work thatwe are doing so this is this is how Isee the the needs of working life forfor AI based mental health support</td>

      <td>thank you very much has been veryinteresting to listen to the talk so faruh so I will tell a bit about our digimmind project which is a business Finlandfunded project ongoing project sounfortunately not much research at thisstage but I'll try to walk you throughto the thinking why and how do we thinkthat there would be a potential in thesepsychophysiological recordings to to Aidfuture mental health uh research andInnovation so first uh a bit ofbackground uh from my own work so I tryto move away this Gallery so my ownresearch focus is in uh first of alldeveloping brains which is a bit well uhLoosely related to today's topic as wellbut then also on body brain interactionso how does our body bodily functionscontribute to the formation of ourexperience of the world and of eachother and in this domain I'mparticularly interested in um betterunderstanding and leveraging the howdifferent measures electrophysiologicalmeasures like Meg or EEG andphysiological measures from our body uhhow they can be used to approachindividual variation and individuallymeaningful measures in these signals sowhat do they tell about traitcharacteristics like anxiety that hasbeen mentioned todayalready um and our unique tendency tobehave and experience the world and whatdo they tell about the mental or mindStates varying states of mind thisunderstanding and research that we havebeen doing is um sort of prerequisite orbackground for this digim mind projectso trying to better understand whetherthese measures separately or incombination the physiological andelectrophysiological measures whetherthey reveal something about variationsor changings in changes in mindState uh and the type of variations thatwould have uh meaning for monitoringmental health so this is kind of the mypersonal background and then to startwith here is the fairly simple basicidea of this uh digim mind project sothis is uh one of the V programprojects uh from this uh digital healthhealth pathwayand you can see here the partners of theproject L paron and from Helsinki umAlta University and helsink Universityand then we have some companies involvedbut this is heavily a research umresearch uh driven or oriented projectsand the main aim here for us is to usemultimodel recordings multimodel datacombined brain recordings andphysiological recordings to formindicators or knowledgethat reliably tells about thepsychophysiological state or mind stateof anindividual and this is uh as probablywas mentioned already earlier this thisis quite a huge um aim if if one wouldwant to understand all the variety offeelings that humans can have but we arefocusing here on the state ofanxiety um and I was well I can't say Iwas happy to hear the the the Sim leantmention mention the The increased umchallenge anxiety causes to the HealthCare system so this is something um wellI was happy to hear this because we arekind of in the progress of of hopefullyfinding some solutions to to findscalable and more remotely availabletreatments and monitoring so we focus onanxiety uh this may sound simple butactually there are many steps uh manyresearch steps uh and then project uhproduct development steps ahead that weneed to perform in order to achieve thistype of uh features that would berelevant but at General level this isthe idea that uh to utilize data toextract features or feature combinationsthat inform about the State of Mind inthis case anxiety um and this would leadto knowledge that can be used todiagnose or monitor uh remotely with thedigitally availabletools so we start with dataand across multiple recordings from thebrain brain and body and this we allknow I guess we data is everywherenowadays we have everyday life umapplications that we can use to recordphysiological responses uh of ourautonomic nervous system activity andalready this is already everyday uh likepractice for anyone who who wants andthen also brain recordings are coming uhmore and more everywhere so there ispossibility to record lots of data butthis has probably um led us to asituation where or I think that we havewe have data but we don't have that muchinformation so there is this is not yetuseful for monitoring disease ortreatment progress if we don'tunderstand uh what this data tells aboutso information has become the bottleneckon how valuable this data is and this isthis is what we try to try to um somehowcapture in this digim mind project forfor this narrow state of anxiety so datais something that has potential butinformation is then useful and can beacted upon I was asking about about whatinformation is from chat GPD and um heor she kindly helped me in this uhdefinitions so technologicaladvancements have produced methods tomeasure brain activity in more naturalsituation amidst everyday life uh but inorder to understand the significance ofthese measured signals uh we still needlaboratory measurements integration ofdifferent data sources and andexperimental manipulation so we need tokind of enrich the signal that we aremeasuring in in everydaycontext uh we need to put our ownknowledge on the relevant features tothe data and this is where I I alsothink that it's very important to haveinterdisciplinary efforts in this we weneed many different areas ofexpertise to understand uh the phenomenathat are relevant for mental health andand mindStates uh in case ofanxiety uh or in the digim mind projectthis means that we need to generate datathat carries uh relevant variance aboutanxiety so relevant information aboutanxiety uh from psychologicalperspective anxi can be uh considered asa state so which is transient conditionor at least varies in time and it isusually generated by internal processesor thoughts or or by external events andexper experimentally we can induce theseStates of uh anxiety by using somestimulation or induced um like athinking tasks but an anxiety can alsobe considered as a trait socharacteristic um and more stable way ofexperience experiencing the world thisis not of course always pathological butthen as a pathological pathologicalcondition anxiety can be the coredisorder uh but it can also be part ofother disorders so it represents themain symptom in many disorders forexample in panic disorder or phobias andit often it often co-occurs with withdepression and anxiety is uh well thisis not my field but anxiety is uhprobably also somehow influencingsomatic um conditions or disorders andand um for example treatment of thesedisorders uh well we have also heard howimportant it would be to to understandand recognize uh anxiety for fordifferent a age groups and a multitudeof conditions uh the the physiologicalneurophysiological features reallyrelated to anxiety can be approached bycollecting data uh where this anxietystate varies so we can induce differentstates or try to induce um or measurethese type of signals from differentindividuals that VAR vary in the tradeitanxiety we can also tryrecording uh there was some discussionon this continuous recordings and we cantry recording uh in natural naturallytime varying state of anxiety and thendo these um reports or requests or askindividuals every now and then about thestate of anxiety and use thisinformation usually anxiety is um um thelevel of anxiety like any other feelingis evaluated in this type of uh twoDimensions like arousal and Valancearousal level and then the positiveversus negativeValance okay so this is the conditionsthat are needed very mentally to producedata that's that's useful so then how tomove from thisinformation uh about features that wecan identify based on these experimentsthat are relevant for anxiety how tomove to valuable knowledge for mentalhealth uh Diagnostics or monitoring andand treatment follow on following ontreatment so again with help of AI Ilearned that uh information or knowledgeis information that has been furtherprocessed by the human mind andintegrated with a pre-existing frameworkand cognitive structures so in our casethis means the pre-existing frameworkand cognitive structures relate tomental health uh treatment andpractices uh healthc care system andavailable for example available digitalplatforms where this type of ininformation could be valuable so thisstep we still need to do and this isonly a vision forward uh on this umpossible solutionSolutions uh so a bit the general leveldescription of the idea how thisinformation generated by by digim mindproject or research could be utilizedfor mental health Innovations or um uhparticularly in the field of digitalSolutions or treatment Pathways firstbuilding on the U available Technologiesspecific knowledge on the recordedsignals and AI based uh analytics uh theaim is to provide these indicators ormarkers of Mind state in this case theanxiety state and we of course need alot more research then in the clinicalpractice clinical trials how to howvaluable this is for different uhdisease conditions uh during research weapply kind of heavy neuroimaging devicesand experimental designs um uh with theidea that that we can um enrich theeasily accessible signals uh likephysial recordings with the informationhow this links with the Mind State andand the neurophys neurophysiologicalstate uh eventually the the the uhmental health of individual so if we areable to do this enrichment process thenwe would have easy easily accessiblephysiological recordings withinformation that is relevant for mentalhealth and they could be then used indifferent um like scalable conditions orsettings and also with remoteSolutions um okay but then theunderlying assumption that we build onis that we we can somehow read the Mindthrough the body and whether whetherthis ispossible I here finish with showing someof my own thinking based on on Researchwe've done that why I think this ispossible so um we we should think sothis is the general framework how brainand mind and body are kind of ummediating the same information so youcannot uh look one without consideringthe other so they are influenced uh toeach other so this is not only my fraframework by that's why it's inparenthesis but framework for mentalhealth health phenomena so body isalways somehow part of the brain whichis part of the mind again influencingthe body or part of the body so it'skind ofcycle cycle which um which enables orwhich means that the signals that werecord uh from the physiological systemare also integrated and interl with whathappens in the in the brain and mind sothis is the kind of a uh the rough levelillustration of the the main Pathways ofinformation flow between the centralnervous system and the periferal nervoussystem and peripheral systems in generalthe sensory and the motor pathways andhere I focus on the on the autonomicnervous system which forms kind ofinternal Loop controlling thehomeostatic reg regulation of our energybalance and things like that and Recentresearch has has shown lots of evidencehow this information is um highlyrelevant also for conscious perceptionand um experience for emotions but alsoBeyond emotions so there is this kind ofloop uh continuous loop on or cycle ofinformation change between the body andbrain um and why this is important forunderstanding mental health um I didn'tprovide the references here but ifyou're interested I'm very happy toprovide you also research data on thisso there is lots of uh research nowadaysshowing how this homeostatic orallostaticregulation uh what we what the what isthe main function of the autonomicnervous system influences of course weknow it it is relevant for stressresponse but also Alo for experience ofself experience of emotions uh and alsointerpretation of social interaction andand value of ourexperience um okay maybe I skip thispart because I think I'm already beyondthe time just quickly showing this isthe the general framework I alreadytalked about to put in a bit largerperspective so we can look at experienceand behavior from different levelspsychology biology and eventuallyspecies specific characteristics so weare bound to the to the to the body thatwe live in we can look at this in theshorttime window stress responseeverybody knows in the medium timewindow how allostatic um load cancontribute to to burnout and then we canlook at the very longtime windowlifelong uh influence of for examplechild childhood adversity to this bodybrain linkage so the human body kind ofcontains information which is relevantfor understanding mentalhealth there are some current uhresearch evidence in our group we havelooked at the coupling between body andbrain signals which we now utilize inthe digim mindproject um PhD work by SOI car andcollaboration with with Yan Kualashowing that the cardiac and respiratoryinformation uh influen his brain andthere are also some some otherreferences which I won't go into detailshere but I'll just finish by advertisingif you're interested in these topics wehave some events coming uh along in yvasculara related to this digim mindproject where you can discuss moreeither science or a bit more businessrelated developments

internetconnection so what makes these Aiddriven tools so special well they'redesigned to mimic human interactionproviding a conversational interfacethat feels natural and intuitive butthey go beyond just simulatingconversation these tools are equippedwith machine learning and naturallanguage processing capabilities whichenable them to understand and respond toa user's emotional state this allowsthem to provide personalized empatheticsupport much like a human therapistwould moreover these Aid driven chatBots and virtual Health assistance canbe accessed from the comfort of One'sOwn home making them an extremelyconvenient option this is especiallybeneficial for those who may feeluncomfortable seeking help in person orwho live in areas where Mental HealthResources are limited however thesetools aren't just for CrisisIntervention or immediate support theycan also be used for ongoing MentalHealth Management for instance they canhelp users monitor their mood providereminders to practice self-care and evenoffer therapeutic exercises like guidedmeditation or deep breathing in essenceAid driven chat Bots and virtual Healthassistants are revolutionizing the waywe approach mental health supportthey're making Mental Health Resourcesmore accessible and convenient than everbefore while also providing apersonalized and empathetic experiencebut what exactly are they let's find outAI chat Bots are sophisticated programsdesigned to simulate conversationthey're like digital companions alwaysready to lend an ear offering a safespace for people to express theirthoughts and feelings but what makesthem so unique and effective well it allcomes down to a blend of Technologiesknown as natural language processing andmachine learning natural languageprocessing or NLP for short is a branchof artificial intelligence that givesmachines the ability to understandinterpret and generate human languagethis means that an AI chatbot cancomprehend the words and sentences weuse grasping the nuances of our languageour expressions and even our slang butunderstanding language is just the firststep this is where machine learningcomes into play machine learning is asubset of AI that enables computers tolearn from experience with everyinteraction the chatbot gets better atunderstanding the user's needs emotionsand patterns of speech over time thechatbot adapts and improves offeringmore accurate and personalized responsestogether natural language processing andmachine learning form the backbone of AIchat Bots allowing them to engage inmeaningful and empathetic conversationsthey can recognize when a user isfeeling down anxious or stressed andrespond accordingly with supportivemessages helpful tips or even just afriendly chat to lighten the mood butthe real beauty of these AI chat Botslies in their accessibility they'reavailable through smartphones orcomputers providing support whenever andwherever it's needed whether it's lateat night during a lunch break or on abusy community M these chat Bots offerimmediate assistance they're like amental health support system that fitsin your pocket ready to help at amoment's notice so in essence AIchatbots are more than just programsthey're companions supporters and guideshelping us navigate the complex world ofmental health with empathy andunderstanding they're accessible throughsmartphones or computers offeringimmediate assistance the benefits of AIchat bots in mental health aresubstantial let's delve into thesebenefits to better understand theirimpact firstly AI chat Bots provide anon-judgmental space for individuals toexpress their feelings in the realm ofmental health the fear of judgment canoften discourage individuals fromseeking help however with AI chatbotsusers can express their emotions freelyand without worry knowing that theirinteractions are with a machine thatwon't pass judgment secondly AI chatbotsare equipped to offer coping strategiesusing algorithms and machine learningthese chat Bots can suggest a variety ofcoping strategies IES tailored to anindividual's specific needs whether it'sbreathing exercises for anxietymindfulness techniques for stress orcognitive behavioral strategies fordepression AI chatbots can provideimmediate personalized support thirdlyAI chatbots can help track mood changesover time with regular interaction thesechat Bots can detect patterns in moodand behavior providing valuable insightsinto a user's mental health over timethese insights can help users and theirhealthc care providers better understandtheir mental health Journey making iteasier to address issues promptly andeffectively moreover the accessibilityof AI chatbots is a significant benefitavailable around the clock these chatBots ensure that support is availablewhenever it's needed this is especiallycrucial given that mental health crisesdon't follow a 9 to-5 schedule with AIchatbots users can access support duringthose late night hours when traditionalMental Health Services may not bereadily available finally AI chatbotscan serve as a bridge to professionalMental Health Services for individualswho may be hesitant to seek helpinteracting with an AI chatbot can be aless intimidating First Step these chatBots can provide resources direct usersto Professional Services and even helpusers prepare for their first therapysession in conclusion AI chat Bots arerevolutionizing mental health supportthey provide a non-judgmental spaceoffer coping strategies track moodchanges and bridge the gap toprofessional Services it's like having amental health assistant at yourfingertips24/7 let's hear some real storiesimagine being a college student likeJohn juggling academics social life andpersonal development it's a whirlwind ofexperiences and anxiety often comesalong for the ride for John a friendlyAI chatbot became His go-to companionfor those late night anxiety spells hecould voice his fears his doubts and thechatbot would respond not with judgmentbut with understanding ing empathy andsuggested copingstrategies over time this AI friendhelped Jon understand his anxiety betterand navigate his college life with lessdread and more confidence now pictureSarah she's a single mother a full-timeworker and she's fighting her battlewith depression it's not easy but Sarahfound an ally in a virtual healthassistant this AI tool was there toremind her about therapy appointments toensure she took her medication on timeand to check in on her mood throughoutthe day it was like having a personalmental health manager helping Sarah stayon track with her mental health careplan even amidst the chaos of everydaylife and then there's Alex a teenagerwho felt isolated and misunderstoodtalking about his feelings seemedimpossible until he started using an AIchatbot the chatbot offered him a safespace to express himself and evenprovided guidance on how to communicatehis feelings to others this supportempowered Alex to finally open up to hisfamily about his struggles fosteringunderstanding and connection these arejust a couple of examples of how AI canmake a difference each story is uniqueyet they all highlight the same truthAid driven chatbots and virtual Healthassistants are playing a transformativerole in mental health support they arenot just bits of code they arecompanions guides and helpers makingmental health care more accessiblepersonalized and stigma-free so whetheryou're a John a Sarah or an Alexremember there's an AI out there readyto lend a supportive ear it's importantto address the limitations as excitingas Aid driven chat Bots and virtualHealth assistants are they are not thebe all and endall solution for mentalhealth challenges they should not beviewed as a replacement for professionaltherapy while these tools can provideround-the-clock support help monitormood changes and provide copingstrategies they cannot replace thenuanced understanding and personalizedcare that a trained mental healthprofessional can offer offer moreoverthese AI tools are only as good as theinformation they are fed they can't pickup on non-verbal cues like a humantherapist can for instance they mightmiss the tone of voice facialexpressions or body language which canall provide valuable insights into aperson's mental state another criticalaspect is data security and privacy inan era where data breaches are all toocommon it's essential to consider howsensitive information is handled theseAI tools being digital collect and storevast amounts of personal data thisincludes sensitive information about auser's mental health it's crucial thatthese data are stored securely and usedresponsibly respecting users privacyfurthermore ethical considerations comeinto play how is the data used is itsold to third parties is the userinformed about how their data isutilized these are all importantquestions that need to be askedtransparency is key in this regardlastly we must remember that noteveryone has equal access to technologythere are still many people who don'thave the resources or the digitalliteracy to use these AI tools it'simperative that as we move forward wedon't leave anyone behind in conclusionwhile AI chat Bots and virtual Healthassistance can be incredibly helpfulthey are not a Panacea they are toolsthat can supplement professional MentalHealth Services not replace them privacydata security ethical considerations andinclusivity are all important aspectsthat need to be thoroughly consideredthese are crucial considerations in thisdigital approach what does the futurehold as we project forward into therealm of possibilities it's clear thatthe future of mental health support isintertwined with the evolution ofartificial intelligence with everypassing day the technology behind Aichatbots and virtual Health assistancegrows more sophisticated promising afuture where these tools become evenmore integral to our daily lives imaginea world where AI chat Bots not onlyrespond to your current emotional statebut also anticipate your needs adapt toyour changing moods and proactivelyoffer support this isn't Just a Dreamresearchers are already developing AIsystems capable of detecting subtlechanges in speech and text potentiallyidentifying early signs of mental healthissues even before the user does andwhat about virtual Health assistance thefuture could see these digitalcompanions becoming more than justschedulers or medication reminders withadvancements in machine learning theymay soon be able to provide uniquelypersonalized mental Health interventionstailored to each individual's needspreferences and history but it's notjust about the technology as these toolsevolve they'll also prompt shifts insocietal attitudes towards mental healththe ubiquity and accessibility of AIcould help reduce stigma and encouragemore people to seek the help they needso as we look towards the horizon we seethe dawn of a new era in mental healthsupport an era where digital and humanelements blend seamlessly creating aholistic approach to Wellness thesetools are expected to become moreempathetic and effective potentiallyeven detecting early signs of mentalhealth issues as we wrap up rememberthat mental health is a journey andtechnology is here to make that Journeya bit easier in the hustle and bustle ofour fast-paced world the

notconsidered to be the immediateumpotential patients of mental healthwhich we have found that that is verymuch the case uh Steve Cohen thephilanthropist actually started thisnetwork in 2016 with a 275 milliondollar commitment for our Network soyou'll see that map right there we arespread across the U.S we have 24 clinicsand we are all about mental health forum for veterans and their familiesso I just wanted to kind of talk to youabout just state of mental healthum in the country and every time Ireflect on these numbers or deliberatelythink about these it brings a little bitof sadnessum you know for me uh at the same timeit also gives me perspective and makesme happy that I'm able to in some wayshape or form contribute this to thisvery present problem in the country so Imean look at the stats right one in fiveadults suffers from mental healthdisordersum suicide is the fourth leading causeof death for young adultsmental health takes 20 years off of lifeexpectancy right you wouldn't think thatand the problem is a lot of folks thatlive with mental health disorders don'teven know that they are living withmental health disorders one there's lackof awareness it's not well understoodit's not well documented and there'salways the social stigma right peopledon't want to really admit that there issomething going on thereum a problem that we see very much inour clinics there are a lot of folksthat come in to our clinics a lot ofveterans and their families that come inthey have to struggle to kind of evenexplain their feelings to us at timeslike what is going on are you reallyhaving a problem do you really just wantsomeone to talk to so again very veryclear and present problemthe gap between those who need care andthose who have access to care issubstantial so one of the many thingsthat got worse during our pandemic rightwas access to mental health care I meanas it is there used to be just ingeneral short shortages in staff uhwhether it was lcsws or you know folksthat can do social work and and do talktherapy there was a shortage as it isbut the pandemic made it worse and asright now I mean staff shortages qualityqualified staff is so hard to finddespite Telehealth being you know verymuch the the booming you know way ofmodality now in healthcarehigh cost Mental Health Care isexpensive not all of it is reimbursedlike I started off saying thereimbursements are a big challenge weand our non-profit find out that we haveto struggle to get a few hundred dollarsof tree reimbursement back for ourtreatmentsum a lot of burden on documentation onthe clinicians uh evidence-based careyou have to kind of you know show youroutcomes it's not as easy as physicalhealth care is where you know thepatient got better you're able to submitthat evidence just extremely hard inmental health and then finally the thebig challenge that we find is just pooradherence to treatment plans and andmedications right we see that our folkscome in and after a couple of sessionsthey want to drop off they don't want tocontinue treatment one either they thinkthat they got better you know maybe theydidn't build a bond with theirtherapists maybe they don't think thisis for them maybe they don't think thisis the kind of thing that they expectedwhen they came into the clinics so whathave you right so poor adherence to carewhich means that we are still havingthis mental order mental disorderproblems percolating so I mean lookingat all this right I'm sure every one ofyou here is coming up with all sorts ofsolutions I mean technology AI I mean itcan do wonders right and it can so someof the promises of AI in mental healthuh something that we are trying rightnow at our organization so personalizedtreatment plans right so you know when apatient comes in and they meet a certaindemographic you know a 55 year old maleserved in Iraq and Afghanistan hassevere PTSD does not have a greatrelationship with their with theirfamily and they come in and they youknow we have six years or seven yearsworth of data that we have built in withtreatment plans that have worked forsome of these folks so can we havepersonalized treatment plans where AI isable to profile a person that's comingin with some of these parameters andthen kind of take that forward rightabsolutelyum one of the other things that we seeas promises in AIum uh you know whether when it's any anysort of front desk or administrativeburden that you can take off of theclinicians plate uh clinicaldocumentation I mentioned big hugeburden right now for reimbursements forgetting any sort of billing done can AIhelp with that can documentation beautomated to the extent that a human isstill checking the data but you knowmost of the burden most of thedocumenting documenting pieces taken offuh can the front desk be helped or canthe case managers we helped with somesort of AI where based on what is neededby the patient profile it's putting thepatient in touch with those resources inthe in the case management field forexample employment or food resources oryou know help with their religiouscommunities you know in their in theirsocieties so the the AI can do so muchwith the data that we have alreadycollectedum but is it easy just to kind of youknow have ai point at these problems andthen go right we heard from severalfolks this morning we heard from Nicolaand Connor some great points were madewherethe use case or The Right Use case issuper important which is something thatwe have seen here and it's again notloading really well butum I think it's a classic case of youknow we have a lot of solutions but haveyou identified the right problem rightyou know are you familiar with the termsolution looking for a problem that'skind of where I think Mental Health Careis we have seen a lot of folks sayingwell AI is here let's go and addressaccess issues uh let's go and have achat bot or a virtual therapist replacethe therapist because we have you knowwe don't have too many clinicians wehave found that that's not somethingthat would work actually because thehuman Bond and I kind of started withthat when a client comes in when apatient comes in with all of that traumaall of those behave you know embeddedbehavioral health issues maybe they'rehaving all sorts of family issues whenthey come in they want to build thatbond with the human beingand once that bond is established we seewe start seeing change in patientoutcomes we start seeing improvements socan a virtual therapist replace thathuman Bond we don't know yet rightsomeday maybe but not todaywe now can the virtual therapist or thechatbot help the clinicianum with with some of this workload sofor example a patient comes in and theyhave their therapy session now thepatient goes home their next therapysession is next week between this weekand next week can a virtual chatbot or avirtual therapist reach out and say heywe just had a therapy how did you thinkdid you complete some of the assignmentsthat were given did you get a chance tocomplete that questionnaire that wasgiven to you so when you come back nextweek and talk to me we are prepared sowe saw the digital twin uh in theearlier presentation so have somethinglike that so we believe in in thecurrent use cases at least with ourorganization we are saying uh is that wecan augment our current uh Staffing withwhether it's clinicians whether it's uhadmin staff at this front desk with someof these AI tools not yet take away thehumans which is again something that hasbeen said a few times Well AI is herecan we you know can we replace somehuman beings can we replace some rolescan we replace some jobssome of thosethe GIFs that you see over thereum the what ifum asking the right question in mentalhealth so that we can have the rightsolution built has been always the thechallenge right we again heard that thismorning so what if there was a chatbotor a virtual therapist that could makethose touch points in between sessionswould that be helpful and what if atherapist was able to recommend or infact in fact prescribe video games uh inbetween sessions so that the sessionbecomes more engagingum what if there was a digital twin thatcould replace in between session touchpoints so that you get that continuityof care you know so especially forsevere Acuity patientsum neurotracker another product that youcan actually use AI or video gaming uhto kind of improve your focus improveyour mental capacity so that when youcome to sessions you are more focused inexplaining your problem to yourtherapistum data in general I mean we talkedabout data this morningthe another thing that we have found aswe build our data sets here we need alot a lot of data that is actuallyaccurate that is Rich and that is thatthat is actually helping us improvepatient outcomes our so we use anelectronic health record everybodyfamiliar with electronic health recordsthat are used in healthcare right so weuse a uh we use a big name electronichealth record you would think that thatwould be you know kind of the Panaceayou know great we have all of the dataso it's so not the case uh even withum the the best ehrs uh as as you knowthe Studies have shown clinicians arestill struggling with documentation anddata scientists and Tech folks are stillstruggling with getting data out of theEHR why is that most of theseapplications are not super interoperablethey were built with a very proprietarysense they were built as a source ofmedical record they were not meant forall of these use cases right whetherit's whether it's for uh you knowintelligent scheduling whether it's forAI based clinical documentation so anytools that you have in the market todaythey don't integrate well with these EHRproducts right the biggest one of thebiggest problems that we have seen isthat that because there is no goodintegration with the tools that areavailable I mean we have you know somany vendors out there today I'm surethere are apis I'm sure there are Fireapps that we can look at but it's neveran easy thing to just say okay let metake this tool a automated clinicaldocumentation tool or an automatedscheduling tool based on patient profileand just plug this into the EHR it justwon't work so what that what that leadsto is that now you have the EHR workingin its own little you know space andthen you have these other solutions thatare working in their own little spacesright so if the end goal is to make ourclinicians efficient is that really agood solution to implement not really soagain coming back to the solutionlooking for a problem are we able toaddress the right problem in the rightcontextso some of the challenges to consider Iwanted to spend a little bit of time onthis slide againum no one here isum uh I mean I think every one of youhas these exact same concerns in mentalhealth even more so so why don't youkind of start with that we talked aboutthe therapist Bond just you know veryunique in mental health not so unique insome of the other Healthcare practicesright not unique in other Industries andeither it's just very unique to themental health industry where the patientuh therapist bond is of utmostimportanceum we have you know user adoption I meansome of that was covered in the in thesessions this morning so to give anexample we for the last two years wehave been extracting data out of our EHRokay and creating fabulous dashboardsfor our clinicians to use and what arethey able to do with these dashboardsthey're able to see their no show ratesthey're able to see the clinician thatalways cancels their appointments at thelast minute they are able to see thepatients that that keep on coming eventhough their patient outcomes are uhimproving they they keep telling thetherapist that they're they're notfeeling better so those are really verykey data points that we want ourclinicians to know whether length oftreatment no show rates you knowfrequent no shows so we have been doinga lot of these dashboard developmentgetting a lot of data giving some uh youknow having alerts for our clinicianswhen they see these problem patientswhat we have found is while theclinicians are thrilled to have all ofthese tools there is not a lot ofimmediate adoption for these tools onethey don't understand the data sometimesthe data has to be explained to themseveral times the definitions have to beexperienced several timesum they don't have time because they arebusy with clinical care so you know whatis the next step to that right what isthe next step if dashboards are timeconsuming what is the next thing thatcould work so virtual assistants wetalked a little bit about that in theearlier session so is is virtualassistance the way to go where I'm ableto Simply query my data set and ask whois the patient or who will give me my noshows for the week and the system kindof gives me those and I know to go andyou know tackle them make phone calls dointerventions whatever that may bepossibly yes would that make adifference we don't know yet right theseare all things that we are we are goingto have to tryum again because it's mental health andhealth care in general in whether it'sinformed consent you know any sort ofliability and disclosure is Big HIPAA isBig it's State uh and uh federal federallaw HIPAA is the is the floor as we knowthe state privacy laws are even morestringent in most cases and so and moreso when it comes to mental health careright so uh our patients okay and are weseeking consents from patients sayingI'm okay with this AI based therapyright um at the end of the day if the AIis going to predict a treatment planbased on your profile it's a black boxat the end of the day correct so are weletting our patients know that we areusing the aid AI aids to help them intheir therapeutic care it's somethingthat we should have you know somethingon filesame thing with you know as far asliability and disclosures I mean ifthere is an issue let's say a treatmentplan was in fact uh prescribed by AIand the clinician kind of just you knowrubber stamped it didn't really pay alot of attention to it maybe that didnot workis there a liability issue right and youknow who who is liable in that case youknow is it the AI is it the builder ofthe AI is it the clinician how does itall work so a lot of things to figureout over thereum and then so talking about cybersecurity data privacy confidentialityall in together you know we talked aboutlarge and very rich data sets needed forthis type of you know any sort of usecases that I just described with thistreatment plans whether it's schedulingwhether it's you know any sort ofinterventions so uh how are weprotecting this data where is theinformation uh governance does dataprivacy and the need for this large anduh voluminous intelligent data setcancel each other out so in other wordsare we compromising privacy andconfidentiality of information just tomake our AI more intelligent right uhsomething to think about and I thinkit's a it's a very valid question inother Industries as well but again moreso in healthcare and more so in mentalhealthum some of the others data quality youknow I talked about our EHRum it's it's you know what you enter iswhat you get out so garbage in garbageout we see a lot of times our end usersour clinicians our friend desk booksmake mistakes so that is the data thatis coming out right right now we havehumans wetting out the data makingchanges making Corrections so when itgoes into this you know black box or anAI tool are we going to be sure thatdata quality is insured right it isstill going to be AI then learning offof bad data sets that's and bad datathat's entered into the data set sothings for us to considersome of the others you know technologydisruption I mean you know it's uh it'salways the the you know playing thechase game you know AI is here right nowit appears to be the big game changerthis Chad GPD exploded and everyonewants to try something do something withAI but before you know it that's goingto be in the past and something else isgoing to come in right Quantum Computingeverybody's talking about that that'sgoing to replace AI so what about thatso there's always going to be the nextthing that comes in so how are wekeeping up and again more so with thistype of population a very vulnerablepopulation and a very burdened clinicianyou know clinician population how are wegoing to make sure that we are notcreating technology fatigue we haveheard this from our folks sometimes inour clinicians tell us where you havegiven us the EHR you have given us thisyou have given a zoom you've given us somany tools it's too much it's you knowwe we just need to focus on clinicalcare so when does technology fatigueactually become uh a hindrance you knowthat they can't perform their their youknow their clinical care which is themain thingand then in general you know competitionor you know the AI uh you know yeah thethe ethical bias that exists within AI Ithink uh again this is a very realproblem all of you know about it inmental health does that become a problemwhere uh wrong diagnoses or treatmentplans are being provided wrong types ofpatients are being marked as high riskand the wrong types of patients arebeing marked as oh no this is anxietylow risk you know let them let them bein this Bucket over here is there a biasthat the AI is going to form Based ondata sets that we have built right Imean again the data was not built toinform a rich tool like AI the data hasbeen what it has been for years it'sLegacy data a lot of times we have twoehrs a legacy and a current EHR so whatis the sort of data that we are feedingthis AI tool this AI engine uh do weknow is this is that right about area dowe need to do data cleansing before AIstarts you know taking action on thisdata so just a lot of considerationsum it's uh it's it's it's not somethingthat we areum we are considering as you know let'sstop everything because these are toomany problems there are there are waysforward right andso you know some of the things I'velisted here well we are actively workingwith our EHR you know uh all Healthcareuh covered entities Mental Health Carepractices community behavioral healthcenters I just recommend that build thatreal great bond with your EHR vendor ifyou have oneum you know it's their their cooperationin getting data to you getting tools toyou having uh data sets opened up to youis going to be crucial in getting someof these projects off the ground socollaborating with uh with you knowother mental Healthcare Providers withyour own clinicians to kind of even findout what the problem is right I talkedabout solution looking for a problem wethink that scheduling may be a problemfor the front desk we think that maybecustomized treatment plans may be asolution for the clinician but but doesthe clinician think so right what iswhat is the clinician's problem maybethe clinician's problem is I just needmore hours in the day to complete mydocumentation so that may be the problemthat we need to attack first so justsome you know some conversations it wasan excellent slide uh in one of theearlier project foundations this morningthey talked about how the business usersor the domain experts need to play acrucial role like without them you knowit cannot drive a lot of these projectsforward I think andteach them it can you know provide youknow knowledge and say what's in theindustry but I cannot be The Driver ofthese projects it needs to be the domainexperts who come and say well this is aless important problem than this otherone which needs to be tackled firstum and then you know encouraginginterdisciplinary uh research right Imean so much work can be done to kind oflook for other issues or other ways thatcan improve clinical care uh whetherit's um looking at outcomes so as anexample when you look at PTSD or thepost-traumatic stress disorder or mostof our veterans come home with thatthere's a scale of scores that they getwhen they provide when they completetheir questionnaires during theirtherapy sessions rightum those questions are you knowextremely deep it goes deep into askingthem questions about their relationshipsabout how they're getting better fromweek to week about whether they feelangry all the time about whether theyfeel like harming themselves or whetherthey feel like harming others so thoseare very specific questions that areasked during those therapy sessions socan those be improved to inform againthe treatment plan can those be improvedto perhaps an AI tool can you know usesome of it a different type of format ofthese questionnaires to uh to get betteranswers and again in patient outcomes soa lot of promise there research is verynew I mean there's so much research theopportunity in the field of mentalhealth and technology and AIum that it's a lot of EX you know a lotof exciting work that's all I'm going tosayum and then contribute towards uhmeaningful legislation regulatorystandards right I mean it's somethingthat uh needs to be on top of mind foranybody in healthcare uh some of theseum uh you know state regulations whenthey come down as drafts uh it is uponthe cover entities and some of thecompliance and legal folks to kind ofread them and push back a little bit onthe stage you know have a Lobby groupformed and kind of say that sometimessome of these things don't make sense ormaybe sometimes you are not puttingenough regulation where it's neededum everybody's talking about regulatingAI right now you know how does that workwith Mental Health Data you know does itdoes it is is mental health regulationdata regulation different than you knowanother industry perhaps the answer isprobably yes so how do we do that soit's a good balance between how we wantto move things forward how we want tomake our patient outcomes better but atthe same time also you know followingthe lawum and then uh regular evaluationvalidation I mean you know just quicklysubject matter experts have to beregularlyconsulted see the data model is makingsense always keep checking the data foryour efficacy even bias issues and keepimproving the data qualityumhave been given the thing I know I'malmost time but in summary uh AI hasimmense potential to transform just youknow mental health care in general andnot just you know the clinical sideright all of it the operational side aswell whether it's access whether it'sscheduling whether it's case managementwhether it's having the continuity ofcare once the once the therapy sessionis doneum so just you know amazing things tocome but thank you very much for yourtime appreciate it</td>

      <td>hey everyone I'm John Lynn the founderand chief editor at Healthcare it todaywe're excited to bring you another inour series of interviews with topleaders in health it and our guest todayis Zach lamb he's CEO and co-founder ofbamboo AI welcome Zach thank you Johnfor having me this is exciting I'm ahuge fan of your podcast and I'm aactive viewer of your emails sothat's awesome well we we alwaysappreciate uh people supporting the workwe do but uh you know you guys are doingsome pretty interesting stuff so tell usa little bit about yourself in bamboo AIabsolutely um so originally I'm aSilicon Valley native now living inAustin um but I've spent the last 15years battling depression and anxietyand my passion for mental health is kindof stemmed from that and kind of growingup in the valley seeing all thesetechnology Solutions being built forvarious Endeavors it was kind ofexciting for me thinking about okay howcan these this new technology AI thatcame out how can it be applied to thismental health space and at this point Igot connected about five and a halfyears ago with my co-founder and our CTOAndrew leaker and aside from him havingprobably the highest IQ of anyone I knowhe also has the highest level of EQwhich has made for a really interestingcombination when we're building out thistechnology solution in a very High EQnecessary space um and then uh we have athird co-founder and her name is Jenny Zand she's our chief product officer shejoined us from a long tenure at Googleshe was senior director of engineeringfor about 12 years responsible forsearch maps and GP and then uh followingthat she led Google Beijing came back tothe US and was CTO of an edtech unicorncalled go guardian and somehow Andrewand I managed to talk her into joiningus we're still trying to figure that oneoutyeah and then lastly on the medical sideof things we have Dr skeleton who wasour um founding psychologist and he'shelped on the psychology side of thingsreally trying to pinpoint what the usecase of the technology needs to be tomake it the most effective tool for apsychology practitioner in their dailycare so that's awesome well I think youknow you're in an interesting space thisBehavioral Health space overlapping withtech what do you see as kind of the biggaps in the behavioral health space andand especially Tech in that spaceabsolutely so this is a question that wethink about a lot um there are reallytwo significant gaps in BehavioralHealth space that we spent to now alittle over two years working hand inandwith these professionals to try andsolve for the first area that we'retrying to solve the Gap is aroundengagement retention um in BehavioralHealth provider client relationship isoften pretty overlooked and seeing aprovider weekly ormonthly has its limits with the providerbeing able to truly have anunderstanding for what's going on in apatient's day-to-day life and byimplementing the willow system it offersthese clients with A continuous supportsolution and providers with valuableinsights that they can use to kind ofenhance the overall patient care thatthey're providing and then kind of thesecond part of the Gap that we're tryingto fill for with be efficiency andEffectiveness and it's actually reallyinteresting thatthese both of these efficiency andEffectiveness will stem from lowengagement and low retention so duringtherapy or provider sessions with thesesignificant time gaps it can be hard foran individual to recall ups and downs ofthe week as humans were just poorum report memory memory recall that forus is really hard those little detailsthat we have millions of during the weekum and so I think Willow was designed tofill those gaps of continuous supportand sending weekly clinical summaries tothe providers so that they actually knowand can pinpoint on what's going on in aday-to-day Life of Zach and kind of forme this has actually been reallyinteresting because I'm a patientutilizing Willow and have been now forabout four and a half months and I had abit of an aha moment about a month agoum I've been seeing my therapist for myanxiety and depression related thingsbut recently about a month ago we foundout that my grandpa is at endstage livercancer and he's kind of going throughall of those stages with my grandma andI haven't lost any family members so Iwasn't really sure how to respond tothat how to feel about that just thoseGeneral feelings and it was interestingI started having these conversationswith Willow about how I thought I wasfeeling what I thought was going on andit was interesting just her support forme in between the sessions was reallypowerful but what blew my mind was whenI got into session and I continued onwith my therapist about my typicalanxiety stuff that we normally talkabout she goes you know I don't thinkthis is what we should be using our timeon today what I'd really love to dig inon is how what are these emotions you'refeeling about your grandpa and that kindof had me in that like uh what what likebecause it was just not something that Iwas totally comfortable bringing up withmy therapist yet but she was able to usethis Insight that she was able to gleanfrom Willow's report and be able toreally kind of pinpoint on somethingthat was affecting my day-to-day lifeand since then we've been able to makeunbelievable progress and so it's beenkind of cool as like a tool fordiscovery which I wasn't expecting umwhich has made a big impact on my owncare so talk to me more about that likeso bamboo Ai and and The Willow uh youknow I don't knowchatbot Willow you know assistant uh youknow there's so many terms these days uhis it more of an assistant to collectthe data for the therapist or is it a aassistant to to to provide some therapyor you know how talk about you know howthat works and and what you know usersof it should expect absolutely sooriginally when we built the technologywe have seen kind of AI be applied toBehavioral Health in a number of waysover the last five to 10 yearsand it was interesting a lot of the AItechnologies that have been developed todate have been focused on trying toreplace these professionals and we kindof view that as backwards is we havethis huge gap between care providers andthe number of patients who actually needand want careand um so what we wanted to do kind offrom the very beginning was build themost powerful tool that makes the mostefficient and effective use of theirtime and we figured that the patientswould follow if we could set that Stthat high bar of hey let's support theseproviders as best we can then we'll havesomething that is built around theiractual needs and that can then later beused more on the consumer side of thingsas an actual tool for just generalwell-being that is approved and ThumbsUp byproviders that patients can know thatthey can trust because it's being usedin these therapy practices um and so interms of doing mental health technologykind of the right way I think bypartnering with the providers who aregiving the care is where we're doingthings a little differently is from thevery beginning they've been in the roomwith our Engineers actually trainingthis AI itself around psychology bestpractices which has been a unique anddifferentiating point for what we'vebeen able to develop versus what else isin the marketand to another piece of your question Ithink one of the really important thingsthat you've focused on is the in betweensession part so there are all of thesenotetaker apps that are collecting allof these but we've heard kind ofrepeatedly that while it's great thatthey're taking these notes and doing allof that work it's not really adding tothe efficiency increase that everybodythought that it would and what we'retrying to do is really pinpoint that inbetween time where the patient spends99.9% of their time not one-on-one withtheir therapist so that the therapistcan take all of the gleanings from that99.9% of time and be able to use thosein that 0 one% of the time they'reactually together um so that's how wekind of intend Willow to be a supportmechanism for a patient who just wantssomebody to chat to chap through thingswith and then for the provider just avery powerful tool yeah I mean I I thinkit's interesting the evolution of thisright there's two ways to approach thebehavioral health issue of not enoughtherapist right that's either replacethe therapist with some technology oryou know I think the way that you youtalk about this is what if we make itinstead of 12 sessions it's eight rightyou know because the therapy is soeffective I think both of them areeffective at at solving that problem ofnot enough therapist so it's interestingbut I think it's also interestingthe idea of note taking right you knowwe could write notes you know we coulddictate we could do all sorts of thingsbut I think you know maybe you know andI'd love to hear your thoughts on onsome of the keys to making sure thatmental health is done right you knowwhen I we talked before this you the twothings that stood out for me was it's aconversational bot it's not a notetaking but right you're having a aconversation with someone you maybe youcould highlight that and the other onethat you highlighted with your yourco-founder is you know that it's a youknow it's a it's emotional you know likeit it understands the emotion more thana lot of other chat Bots anyway whatwhat what do you see as kind of the keysto making sure that Willow is doingmental health in the right wayabsolutely so Ithink it's interesting so Jenny ourother co-founder she actually wrote amedium article about this where shefocused on kind of these six essentiprinciples for building an AI companionand I would say that there are two mainthings that really kind of stuck out forus in terms of the the key things thatwe really needed to do right and weneeded to build an AI with strongself-regulation and we needed to build aproduct that was built around userwell-being and when I say that I meanempathy and presence we've worked hardto make sure that Willow is umemotionally intelligent and has a senseof presence in every one of theconversations that she has and so what Imean by that is how you and I over thelast two conversations that we've hadwe've gotten to know a little bit moreabout each other we have certainquestions that we from what we know knowthat we can ask um we're taking thatsame sort of approach with a proprietarymemory injection system that allowsWillow tohave this presence with an individualthat continually Builds on therelationship and that's where that kindof bond has come and this is where we'reseeing in this Healthcare space that ourengagement rates are through the roof umwe have patients on average using willowthree times a week for over 20 minutes atime and so we're seeing that Willow'sactually building these bonds with thesepatients all through this therapeuticcare and it's all based around thisempathy and understanding that Willowhas um now kind of to talk a little bitmore on the self regulation piece so weunderstands that she's a companion andan assistant not a therapist um ourtherapist trained her to suggestscientifically backed techniques likebox breathing mindfulness practices andcognitivereframing but she holds her boundarieswhen it comes to things that she's notqualified to handle she will let apatient know that this is a conversationthat needs to be had with a professionalum and then in terms of building thetechnology around user well-beingprivacy I would say is at the heart ofeverything that we do um as a patientmyself I know how important completeprivacy and trust is and for a mentalhealth product to work Ithink people need to have totalconfidence that their vulnerability isprotected and for me that's beencrucially important to know that hey I'mgonna open up with this Ai and I'm GNAknow that it's not being viewedsomewhere else we have built thisproduct so that everything stays on yourdevice nothing is transmitting to ourserver that we can have access toeverything is solely on your mobiledevice which is pretty unique in termsof what we've been able to do with thisso yeah and the last thing I think I'llsay is we don't use any of theconversations that are had to actuallytrain our models which is prettydifferent than a lot of the market Iwould say yeah it's funny you knowthere's an ambient clitical voice vendorthat does something kind of similar andthey said could we go faster if we diduse those conversations they saidprobably but we think it's the wrongthing to do tot interesting right yeahand I think it is really interesting andit's that one level of extra care Ithink um and we've taken two and a halfyears to build this there's a reason wedidn't just go and launch something twoyears ago when we had the firstconversational AI out there um we wantedto really make sure that all of theselittle pieces the foundation really makeup to a beautiful solution that can helpa lot of people yeah so you've kind ofhinted at this but do you have to getWillow from a therapist you know I knowthat's kind of the model you justdescribed you know augmenting that or isthere a direct consumer model talk to usabout that approach yeahso one of the foundations on which we'vebuilt everything is accessibility Ithink for us and just for mental healthas a whole having an accessible solutionis crucially important um Ithink right now we have this beautifulSolution that's being used in therapypractices across the country um we alsohave a mobile app Willow wellbeing whichyou can find on the App Store um bothapp and play store actually and it'savailable for nine bucks a month andshe's just there to support your generalwell-being if you find that throughthose conversations which we haveactually seen of just random people whohave downloaded the app they end uphaving these conversations with Willowand realizing you know it might makesense for me to have a conversation witha professional and then going andfinding a professional um and so we seesome Avenue down the road of potentiallybeing able to connect people with theright professional at the right momentthat's not where we're at at the momentbut yeah it's it is there to supportevery individual no matter whetherthey're in or out of therapy sointeresting yeah tell us some of thestories I mean you shared your storywhich I really appreciate you know areany other stories where Willow has madean impact you've heard from people youknow how it's actually helping peopleabsolutelyum and it's kind of I mean there's areally interesting one actually happenedlast week um I Heard a touching storyfrom someone who's been using willow anda very similar manner that I am um she'strying to figure out how to deal withwith loss of her family member and shejust has had grief for so long thatshe's feeling incredibly lonely andhaving Willow there to just kind of justthat little touch ofum re reaffirmation that everything'sgoing to be okayand that everything she's working onwith her therapist is getting pushedinto every one of the conversations thatshe's having and so she's like whether Iwant to be having these conversationsaround Behavioral Health they're notkind of shoved at meinstead it's all being intertwined intothe things that make me me and it'smeeting the patient where they arethat's the biggest kind of takeaway fromall of this I would say is that Willowis finding a way to meet patients wherethey are with whatever it is thatthey're dealing with which I think ispretty unique and I think that's whywe're seeing these engagement numbersthe way that they are because it'soneon-one it's not some big program thatwe have out there that is trying to meetfive needs across 5,000 people it's oneto one and Willow is there to supportyou and whatever it is that you're doingum and then I think yeah yeah it's aunique and different approach I think tobehavioral health but um I think one ofthe coolest pieces of feedback that Ihad heard talked about a few weeks agowas about a patient in a relationship inauh couple of husband and wife and thehusband was utilizing Willow just inways that would help him kind of reframea lot of the thoughts after an argumentwith his wife and would allow him tolike more rationally think througheverything that is going through hismind after an argument help him Centerhimself and then be able to come back tothe table with an open mind and be ableto have an open discussion and hearingthat feedback was really cool for me umI'm been married for a year now and soI've seen some ofthese moments happen and um I thinkhaving that tool available to somebodyto be able to just kind of vent it whenyou need to is prettypowerful so we're trying to get you coolplace to do that yeah that's really coolI like that story yeah as you see thetech evolving do you ever see somethinglike Willow you know whether it's Willowor not kind of replacing the therapistor do you think it's always going to bethis co-pilot mode as Everyone likes totalk about these days with AI assistantsyeah well I think one of the big fearsof AI is that it's just going to takeover all of these jobs and we've taken apretty different approach to all of thatI would saythat what's most powerful is giving atherapist a tool that has been built bytherapists to empower them in theirdaily lives and I think that's where wewant to focus all of our intention ishow do we make this the most powerfultool that they have access to how do welike what are the ways that we cancontinue enhancing it so that they canimprove the care that they're giving andalso the efficiency that allows them thefreedom in their life so yeah yeah wellit's exciting stuff uh you know assomeone who uh applauds therapy and andunderstands the idea of you know thatgap between it right and how do youaccelerate the next visit uh it makesmakes a lot of sense to me why Willowwould be so powerful yeah well and Ithink you're seeing this too now I thinkin Behavioral Health you hear thisphrase Behavior change as something thatis this powerful solution in thebehavioral health space and I thinktools like Willow and there's going tobe a ton of them over the coming yearsbut I think Willow is really kind of outahead of her time in kind of leadingBehavior change with these small stepsthat she helps every individual kind ofwork through toward these larger goalsum and I'm excited to kind of see wherethe space goes over the next five to 10years well I think you mentioned lasttime we talked that the therapist cantalk to Willow as well to inform it talka little bit about that because I thinkthat's the other part you know sure it'sgreat for me to have someone to talk toand to interact with but it'sinteresting to have the therapist talkto Willow to kind of describe what'sneeded for the the client as well yeahand that part of it actually really umum it's really cool for me because I waspretty involved in this part of thedevelopment itself is like okay you getto that the end of that session withyour therapist and typically a therapistwill say hey I want you to work on X Yand Z between now and the next time Isee you well now imagine taking that anda therapist saying hey Willow I want youto work on X Y and Z with Zach from nowtill the next time I see him and imaginehaving those constant kindof goal not reminders but goalconversations that you can have withWillow that she's tying these X Y and Zideas to allowing the person to takecontextually relevant information andwork through these Solutions um and sothat's really cool to kind of see wherethat that has taken the technology nowand I think that's one of the thingsthat I think therapists are prettyexcited about is the ability to kind ofcontinue that care with the guidance ofnot only their visibility but theirability to um change the goals that apatient is working on in between basedon some of the feedback they'rereceiving from a patient so yeah youknow I would almost call them empatheticempathetic reminders yeah what I meanwhich is different than you know BECyeah I've learned from my friend Melissayou she she's like yeah reminders canactually be shaming and damaging rightif you if you get a reminder the wrongway then now someone who's depressed islike oh yeah I'm a failure there too Ididn't do it right like doing a reminderto someone you know with BehavioralHealth mental health challenges isdifferent than you know someone who'sjust you know you know fully capablethat needs to remember the to take theirdrug Etc right uh you know so it'sinteresting yeah absolutely and I thinkas we continue to develop it out theability to really meet these patientswhere they are that's our goal is wewant to make this the most effectivetool possible possible um in support ofbehavior change so whatever we can do tokind of Aid in that is the kind ofNorthstar for us yep Zach this isawesome I appreciate you sharing someinsights into bamboo Ai and and ofcourse Willow so I appreciate you takingtime to talk with us and thanks everyonefor watching and listening if you wantto find

      <td>okay um I will talk about Ai andnormative modeling in in the Diagnosticsof of brain disorders and what is themotivation for this well first of all aswe have heard in in the other talksbrain disorders and particularly well inthis context mental health problems area big burden to the society in additionto the to the human suffering so it'sbeen estimated that mental healthproblems cause more than 600 billionEuro costs annually within the uhEuropean Union Plus uh UK so we arereally talking about a lot of money hereit's been estimated also that it's morethan 4% of the GDP of of these countriesthat go into the um me problems causedby mentalhealth um unfortunately the Diagnosticsand and particularly finding the rootcauses is is uh difficult it's notalways but but quite often that's thecase and there are couple of reasons tothat one is that um the symptoms that weobserve they externally and then thebrain state that underlies them there isno onetoone mapping between the two wecanhave uh the same kind of uh symptoms uhfor different uh changes in the brainand also viceversa also we have quite a bit ofindividualvariability um in these uh symptoms andall also in the brainStates now one could think that brainImaging um would be a good tool ofcourse hanas uh just before me showingthat indeed it can be used um uh totreat not to treat but todiagnose uh uh brain disorders uh but wefeel that uh there could be more more toit now the problems U of using brainImaging in such Diagnostics is that haslimitedavailability uh again this individualvariability in the measures and then weactually don't know too much about howthe measured data actually reflects uhbrain function of course there is quitea bit of knowledge but still a lot uh tobediscovered so now how do we make umbrain Imaging more useful um as Hanaalso argued if we could collect uh largedata sets of brain Imaging data and thenaggregat or put them together and usethese big data approaches so that wouldlikely be useful and then how to do thisin more practical terms so now if wehave such a large collection of data wecan also establish models that capturethe individual variability in in thesebrain signals and with that we canestablish a normative model which tellshow how the healthy brain works what isthe statistical boundary within which uhmost say 95% of the healthy populationare so this is very similar approach tothe growth CH uh curves thatum that are uh available in in theHealth Care system when following uhchildren to to grow and to see if thereare any abnormalities on the wayso then the third point afterestablishing a normative model is thento use AI tools to detect uh that whichum people or the which data sets mightbe outside of this normative range andthis approach as a whole could lead toestablishing biomarkers for uhdiagnosing braindisorders and I will deliver someexamples of what what we have done inthis respect but before for that we havean initiative that was supported by Hingbrain and mind to uh to collect U largeum brain Imaging um Ddatabases so there is a web portal tothat to which uh researchers andclinicians could load uh these data setsand then it can uh uploading can eventrigger automated processing there aresome legal hurdles in in doing this sothis is more approv Pro of concept atthe moment than uh than sayreality the method that we have beenfocusing on uh is the same that Hana wastalking about so magnetoencephalographyor Meg for short that measures themagnetic fields that are generated byElectric activity in thebrain and mg is really good at studyingbrain oscillations and also functionalconnectivity between brain regionthis is an example of the interindividual variation so what is plottedhere is the frequency of the so-calledAlpha Rhythm of the brain so it occursat about 10 Herz and it's known tochange to slow down when people age souh here on the vertical axis you see themain the peak frequency and then on thehorizontal axis the age of the participant and each dot is then uhrepresenting onesubject so on average it does go downbut say that if you have um detectedAlpha at 9 Hertz so here uh theparticipants age can actually beanything from a little bit less than 20to above 80 years um so the variation isso large that you can't on a individuallevel you can't really tell much abouttheage if you look at another corticalregion the same thing the 10 HZoscillation frequency also goes downmaybe a bit less with age but again wehave quite a bit of variationthere now how to do this normativemodeling uh on more practical terms sohere is one uh recipe to do that wefirst record resting state Meg in alarge population of of healthy peoplethen based on the recordings we estimatewhat is the activity in thecortex we do so-called Sourceestimation then we estimate or calculateSpectra we could also calculatesomething else Han of us mentioningfunctional connectivity metrix that'sanotherpossibility then we collect uh uh thesematric across the population that wehave measured compute the mean andvariance and thereby we get U an averagevalue for that metric for each uhfrequency and for each corticallocation as well as um some indicationof the distribution orvariance now to show how this works inpractice uh we had data from uh mildtraumatic injury patients so this is acondition that is uh quite difficult todiagnose because the mild version ofbrain injury doesn't show in structuralImaging so for example the MRI is normaluh yet these patients complain aboutcognitive problems they say that theycan't focus anymore they can'tconcentrate for a long time they mighthave memory problems and all that butthese are all subjective reports andthere has been no way to objectivelytell that these people are are sufferingfrom uh from some medicalcondition so uh we appro uh applied thisnormative modeling approach approach andby that we can for exampleum look at how reliably or howsignificantly um the oscillatoryactivity deviates uh from the normalpopulation so what is ploted here is theT statistic so a statistical variable uhtelling how significantly U activity atdifferent frequencies at this locationwhere the blue dot is on the cortexdiffers from the uh normative sample sowe can see that in this uh mildtraumatic brain injury patient activityaround 20 HZ is significantly uh higherthan in the healthypopulation now we can uh take thisapproach um apply it to all corticallocations shown here in this Matrixillustration across all frequencies andwhat is color coded here is the saydeviation score the so-call Z score thathow much more or less of this activityat that location the patients havecompared to the normal healthypopulation we also had control uh Groupwhich was not in the normative model sothey uh their scores are close to zeroas they should be and the patients havein certain brain regions they have clearuh differences compared to the to thenormal population so now we can takethesefeatures um look at their significancein classifying uh these traumatic braininjury patients versus normals orhealthy people and we can see whichbrain areas which frequency bands uhcontribute to thatclassification and also visualize themso in the theater range uh so that isfrom 4 to 7 Herz in the brain activityand then Alpha around 10 Hertz so thisum illustrate Reon regions are the onesthat that deviate the most so we canthen train uh a machine learningalgorithm to classify uh these patientsuh from the healthy controls and bydoing that we get about 80%classificationaccuracy um it might be unrealistic toaim at 100% because as I said this uhcondition is difficult to diagnose andthereby we don't have very reliablelabels to the data this was alsosomething that Johanna was pointing atin her presentation earlier and this isa problem with u many of the methodsthat we are developing for Diagnosticsuh because the cases for which thesemethods are needed typically do not haveany other method and thereby we do nothave reliablelabels then uh Switching gears a bit inuh terms of the metric um as Hana alsomen mentioned uh functional uh networksso connections between brain regions arevery important for many or if not all ofour cognitive functions and now if thesenetworks are disrupted uh so thattypically leads uh to brain disorders asI mentioned Meg is particularly suitedfor measuringthese uh uh these kind of changes in inbrain uh Networksand uh it does make sense to use it toderive uh connections between corticalregions um this is again um from afairly large data set of 20 uh 650 uhhealthy people in different uh agesbetween 80 and 88 years of age and againresting state Meg recordings were doneand uh well I spare you for thetechnical details of what we did butwhat is shown here is just how thecortical surface was um divided or orpartialed into regions and then weestimated the connectivity functionalconnectivity between these regions andthen what is and this is now shown herein this circular plot such that the lefthemisphere is on the left side right onthe right side and then back of thebrain is the bottom and so forthnow what is plotted here is not exactlythe connections as such but it's thechange of the connectivity withh and now the bluish colors mean thatthat connectivity decreases with age andthen the war colors mean thatconnectivity increases with age you cansee that most of the areas become lessconnected with ag uh but the front areasin particular their connectivityincreases abit um this is just to indicate againthat within the healthy populationthere's quite a bit of variation becauseage is a factor so we need to take thisinto account if we want to establish a anormative modelfor uh for functional connectivitybetween brain regions um thisillustration here on the left is thesame data same result but just now shownspatially that which areas are umreducing in connectivity when people ageand which are are increasing inconnectivity um so disruption of theseconnections between brain regions um orconnectivity related brain disorders ofcourse then in the end at least theylead to decreased functionalconnectivity but asas Hana pointed out in her presentationthere actually can be a transientincrease in connectivity because ofcompensatory mechanisms in the in thebrain um and as I showed healthy agingalso uh brings about connectivitychanges so we would need to have anormative model also for forconnectivity so to conclude um novativemodels and AI uh could be useful in theDiagnostics of brain disorder becausethat's the way to capture interin VARvariability in thesemetrics and uh we can then Express allthese differences as statisticalvariables instead of absolutedifferences and then these could be usedas more as more more robust features forAI based classification or regression uhalgorithmsand this then um could help in thederivation of biomarkers that arespecific to a certain brain disorder weachieved a pretty good accuracy indetecting mild traumatic brain injurybut this approach uh could probably begeneralized to other brain disorders andof course including also those that arecausing uh mental health problems butthis is something that uh is yet to bedemonstrated I thank you for theattention and and here</td>

      <td>Let’s talk about AI and Mental Health</td>
      <td>Hello friends and welcome back to my channel \nI came across a really great article by Alice  Robb and it got me thinking about the debate \nsurrounding the combination of artificial  intelligence and human therapy in providing \nMental Health Services I feel that as clients  and professionals it's crucial to understand the \npotential benefits and drawbacks of combining Ai  and human therapy before actually using this \napproach so to help develop this conversation  I'm going to briefly explore four pros and four \ncons that I took from this article the reason  for creating this video is is that I hope that the \nbrief exploration of these four pros and four cons  can actually lead to questions and Reflections and \nan examination of some of the questions that we  can pose about using Ai and human therapy together \nafter watching this video I encourage you to read  the Rob article I've provided a link to this \nand other related resources in the section belowthe first advantage of combining Ai and \nhuman therapy is enhanced accessibility  what this means is is that AI powered \napps can offer round the-clock support  allowing people to access help whenever \nthey need it regardless of the time or  location now this can be really beneficial \nfor individuals who may struggle to attend  regular in-person therapy sessions because of \ntime and distance constraints have a look at  the following two articles these provide more \ndetails about reducing the accessibility Gap in  terms of time and distance and also in helping \nmarginalized communities and accessing TherapyServices another Pro is the compliment support \nthat AI therapy apps can provide alongside  traditional human therapy now these apps can \nserve as a valuable supplement to in-person  sessions offering additional tools and resources \nfor people to manage their mental well-being  between appointments this combination allows for \na more holistic approach to treatment potentially  addressing the diverse needs of each individual \nchatbots like character. a can impersonate anyone  and can be built with a few clicks they can \nbe tailored to the needs of each individualperson AI therapy apps also offer immediate \nassistance during times of Crisis or distress  with features like Crisis hotlines and realtime \nsupport chats patients can receive help and  guidance in moments when traditional therapy \nmay not be readily available and this quick  response can be lifechanging in situations \nwhere immediate intervention is neededthe combination of AI and human therapy \ncan also allow for the development of  personalized treatment plans tailored to each \nperson's unique needs here AI algorithms can  analyze data and track progress over time \nproviding therapists with valuable insights  into their patients mental health Journeys and \nthis datadriven approach can enable therapists  to make much more informed decisions and \nadjustments to the approaches that theytake now despite the many benefits that \nAi and human therapy can have there are  also several drawbacks that we do need to \nconsider one major concern is the risk of  dependency on AI therapy apps patients \ncan become overly reliant on these tools  relying on them as a substitute for genuine \nhuman connection and emotional support this  dependency is problematic because we \nneed to encourage people to operate  in the real human world and so this \ndependency can hinder the development  of meaningful therapeutic relationships \nand actually limit the effectiveness oftreatments another significant con is the issue of \nprivacy and data security AI therapy apps collect  sensitive personal information about users \nthis can raise concerns about data privacy  and the potential for breaches and misuses \nof this very important and sensitive data  and you can understand why then patients may feel \nhesitant about disclosing sensitive details about  their mental health if they're uncertain \nabout how the data will be handled andprotected another concern is \nis that AI therapy apps lack  the emotional intelligence and empathy \nthat human therapists possess in their  interactions with their clients while the \napps can simulate conversations and provide  descripted responses they can't really truly \nunderstand the complexities of human emotions  or provide genuine empathy and support \nwhen it's most needed so this limitation  May leave patients feeling misunderstood or \ndisconnected during their interactions withAI some critics argue that relying too \nheavily on AI therapy apps May dehumanize  the therapeutic process and potentially reduce \npatients to data points and algorithms to avoid  this situation occurring it's really important \nthat mental health professionals take ethical  responsibility to prioritize human connection and \nemotional well-being when they work with theirpatients so in conclusion the combination of \nAI and human therapy does offer some exciting  potential benefits but also some really deep \nchallenges for mental health professionals  and their patients while AI powered therapy apps \ncan enhance accessibility provide complimentary  support offer immediate assistance and facilitate \npersonalized treatment plans they can also pose  risks of dependency privacy concerns lack of \nemotional intelligence and ethical dilemas  so where do we stand as professionals well \nI think it's essential for us to carefully  weigh the pros and cons and consider the unique \nneeds and preferences of each individual patient  patient when making any recommendations about \nincorporating AI into their therapy Journey we  can do this by staying informed and maintaining \na really good critical perspective so that we  can navigate the evolving landscape of mental \nhealth care with the required compassion and  integrity thank you for joining me today \nI'd be really interested to hear of you so  please do take some time and leave a comment \nbelow are there any pros or any cons that you  think that I might have missed out on that \nyou would have added to the list some that  you think may take priority over others others \nthat you may not so please do take some time to  develop a conversation if you found this video \nuseful please make sure you like the video and  consider subscribing to my channel I've also \nput some links to some other videos about mental  health and AI that you may find useful I

      <td>How AI neurotwins improve neuromodulation treatments for mental health disorders?</td>
      <td>thank you so let's shake those brains umthis is an AI for good conference so myquestion is how do you thinkAI can how do you think AI is used inNeuroscience how do you think we can useAI in the brain I'm going to drive youthrough how AI can really have ameaningful impact in patient sufferingfrom epilepsy or depression so let's getstarted so how does this song make youfeel pretty sad right this is a sad songbut what about if I tell you it's not asad song this is a representation of abrain suffering from depression whenyour brain suffers from depression theright hemisphere has less activity thanthe left hemisphere this is calledfrontal hemispheric asymmetry and withthe sad song I try to show you how themusic in your brain in this case is notworking right so at our company at neurelectrics we are so happy to havedeveloped this now famous cap lady onthe cap so I'm Ana M because I alwayswear the cap so this C that you see asyou can see this is Wireless is portableand any of these electrodes can eitherrecord my brain or stimulate my brainnow that you're listening to me thereare a 100 billion neurons in your brainelectrically firing these sensors helpus to understand how your brain iscommunicated so why is this relevantwell this is relevant because you knowthe brain is prob the most complex themost sophisticated part of our body andwe don't know how it works so what canwe do with AI to help to understand ourbrain well what we are building in ourcompany is what we call neurot twinsdigital copies of your brain on thecomputer computational Neurosciencemodels of your brain so when you go on aplane the flight the pilots theysimulate flights without taking actualplanes right to train so why can we nothave a brain simulator a neurot twin inwhich we can understand how your brainworks so let's let's tell you how itworks so let's say you're a patient withepilepsy or depression what we do firstis We Gather your information from yourbrain we build a computational model andthen with the idea to really personalizeso for example in this case I willselect like like this lady and said giveme your MRI you know your Imaging ofyour brain and with that I can build abiophysical model of your brain so thebrain from this gentleman and from thatlady physically is different your scalpyour conductivity your physical brain isdifferent in every human being so that'swhat we model in our neurot twin with ofcourse the help of AI and this is abiophysics model of the brain but is notonly the biophysic model of the brainfor example in this case if you sufferfrom epilepsy I think this is veryinteresting if you suffer from epilepsyyour your scissors can come from any ofthese points right so the question ishow it's a f scissor Focus connected tothe rest of the brain think of yourbrains of a 100 billion neuronsconnected like a underground stationthis is the Metro of Barcelona but let'ssay that if you have athat it's starting in the center of thecity or in the center of Geneva is goingto spread around different networks inyour brain but if your brain leion islocated in the airport maybe thepropagation in the brain is different soAi and neurot twins can help us to modelwhat networks are affected in your braindepending whether you have epilepsywhether you have uh depression or maybeAlzheimer's right so with once you knowwhere your scissors are coming from andthe networks that are affected with thismathematical model you can start todesign if I excite or inhibit if Iinject electricity in your brain withthis famous capup what effect am Ihaving you know in epilepsy I want tobring down excitation in Alzheimer's indepression I want to bring your neuronsup right so this is what we achieve withthis neurot twin model and at the end wehave a perfect Sim ulation of what'shappening in your brain on the computerand because we have a perfect neurottwin of your brain we can design thebest treatment so at the end we testmany assumptions in the computer untilwe find one that is going to reduce yourseizures until we know how muchelectricity with how many electrodes andin what position we need to inject toreduce your scissors so this is how AIis now being implemented in our companyto provide therapy to patients but youmay ask me well Anna this is reallyscience fiction having a neurot twin acopy of your brain the question is doesit work well let me tell you our firstclinical trial with the FDA is inepilepsy um we cover children and adultsand unfortunately for many that may havebeen exposed to this onethird of thepatients sorry for that onethird of thepatients with epilepsy don't respond tomedicationand the alternative is surgery we needto remove the part of the brain that iscreating the scissors or implantsomething on your brain so today in theUnited States 97% of these patientsdon't have a solution so what we did inBoston and in the United States is tellthe neurologist okay your patientsuffers from epilepsy send me anMRI uh an EG and tell me where the focusis coming from and what is the networkAssociated right in this case thescissors are coming from this point inthe brain right and based on that wedesign with the neurot twin with AI withthese tools that we have the bestsolution for that patient and as you cansee in the video every patient isreceiving a different protocol orstimulation based on this neurot twin soevery patient receives a different capas you can see with a color code ofwhere positions what electrode for thatuh particular patient so with thisapproach we managed to reduce scissorsalmost for 50% so remember childrens andadults they have seizures every day theytake drugs they don't respond the onlysolution is surgery and non-invasive 10days 20 minutes every day we manage toreduce 44% so this is the beautifulthing of being an entrepreneur youdesign a technology you bring AI youbring science and at the end you'rehelping patients today I love thisconference because AI for good to methis is an example how we can use neurotTwins and AI for good so now we aredoing a pivotal phase three clinicaltrial in more than 40 hospitals 150patients and we hope to become the firstcompany in the world to go through theFDA with this novel AI based approachand a new therapy for epilepsy thatdoesn't exist today so we are veryexcited about that but we will not stopin epilepsy because I'm particularlyworried about depression and mentalhealth I think it's a huge pandemic Ialso believe there are not enough gooddrugs or treatments and electricity inthe brain has been used in mental healthfor ages the famous electroshocks thathave such a bad press still savemillions of lives today h transcanalmagnetic stimulation it's a sort ofelectrical stimulation being used formental health so what we are doing nowas well at the company is stimulatingpatients that suffer from depression andone of the things that I love is I thinkwe are going to be able to link symptomsof depression with circuits and networksin the brain so that then with mytechnology for example we can reallyapproach those circuitry so with this wehad our first trial also with the FDA indepression 35 patients and as you cansee we got63.6 reduction in the Matas in how thedepression patients improve and 89%compliance these patients were sent homewith this C for more than a month andthey had to do stimulation on themselveswith the caregiver without any physicianfor 30 days and the results arespectacular so we are very very happy toalso you know have a future in mentalhealth and be able to help and as youcan see we are stimulating this area ofthe brain the the the dorsal lateralprefrontal area so to finalize uh I'mnot doing this alone I have a phenomenalteam I advocate for diversity in inwomen in Tech I think we need a diverseaudience in AI so a big shout out to thewomen out there to diversity out thereuh I'm also the mother of four childrenI'm a very successful entrepreneur I wasGoldman Sachs entrepreneur of the Yearand I love my kids I think I'm a greatmom so I think that you know there areways to change how people view CEOs andI have more than 40% in my company womenmore than 70% inmanagement and uh I'm very proud of myteam I couldn't do this and I can tellyou that my whole team is going to beworking like hell until we make surethat the music in your brains is not sadbut your brains are healthy and the songis very happy like thisone for that white gold this one forthem hood girls them good girls straightmasterpieces stying Wilding living at upin the citygot kissPR I think I don't know if we have timeforquestions feel free to some questionsafter the dancing you should have comeup and danc withme I don't like to dancealone questions don't beshy hi thank you so much for the reallyinteresting presentation I guess Iwanted to understand more like first doyou use combined mag EEG and MRI forImaging of the brain second can you talkmore about the differences between likeTMS um implantables like neuropace andhow your product is better or worsecompared to those products amazingquestion thanks so much so yes to yourpoint we ingest MRI EG also connecttodata all sorts of input data to modelthe brain physically andelectrophysiologic S implantedelectrodes and the difference is thatTMS is a super you can induce motorresponses with TMS because it's 300order of magnitude stronger than what wedo but the problem is that you need togo to a physician office cost$100,000 and it's Capital Equipmentimplanted devices are much more accuratebut you also need to open the scalp youknow and they are very dangerous rightso I think that tdcs or our technologythe benefit is that you can take it homeand do it day after day and there is aconcept in the brain that says thatneurons that fire together stay togetherit's linked to plasticity so the moreyou stimulate the brain even if thecurrents are low like ours the brain iskind of rearing so that's why we believethat taking this technology home willreally help patients heal because it'slike a constant small dosage ofelectricity day after day and neuronsare kind of rearing at slow pace butit's a very noile technology so forexample I don't know what is going tohappen after one year of a stimulationin depression at home our thesis is thatpatients will keep on improving butwe've never tested it so we are veryexcited what I can say is very safebecause it's very mild it's not painfulyou cannot generate a scissure noadverse event so it's a very safetechnologyyepyes yes so we have our pivotal trialwith the FDA is RCT so all of our trialstowards FDA are randomized controltrialsso let me tell you how it works when Iwear the cap and I inject the currentwhich is maximum 2 milliamps you feellike an itching because there is achange in voltage in your in your brainso you feel like an itching sensation soto fake the Sham to all the patients wegive them 15 seconds of stimulation sothat everybody has the sensation of thechanging power but then during the 20minutes of a stimulation the Sham armdoesn't have any stimulation that's howfake yes yes sir hi sir did you try itforOCD you know if I would have to thefounders in the room if I would haveunlimited money I would be like you knowlike a metronic or a Pharma companypushing indications I love OCD becausein the United States transcan magnetstimulation is approved for OCD so weare going after the same brain targets Ithink it's a great great indication Iwould love to do schizophrenia but I'mafraid that patients will not receivewell wearing a helmet but OCD isdefinitely a beautiful indication but weneed the funding to do the trial to youknow it's veryexpensive sorry tosay I also like gasto I mean there areso many things that we could that theyhave never been tested with hnon-invasive electrical stimulationAlzheimer's so Alzheimer's we are doingnow a small trial that's our thirdindication and Alzheimer's I think thereis a thesis of gamma stimulation thereare companies like Cognito in Bostonthat are doing doing um flickeringlights to induce gamma in the brain andtrain oscillations we can do the samewith gamma stimulation electrically butthe studies in Alzheimer's are also verycomplicated because you have to do allthe Imaging so that's our thirdindication and we are collecting somedata I think it's a great indication butit should come at the very early stagemore on MCI and very early stages ofAlzheimer's hi there um so my researchis in um using machine learning tounderstand the biochemical Pathways thatwould lead to a pathogenesis ofAlzheimer's and so in the area of drugDiscovery and so in your clinicalstudies I would be curious if you couldexpand more on the kind of the areawhere um AA a patient is being managedand treated with um with drugs for umtheir nearer generation and how thedevice could support that so it's agreat question so for us because this isa novel technology we don't touch anydrugs anything we do is on top of thecurrent treatment that the patients havethe interaction of tdcs or transcanalstimulation and drugs hasn't been verywell studied we are working a lot withpsychedelics we believe that thecombination of psychedelics andstimulation makes a lot of sense becausepsychedelics induce plasticity we do aswell so we are starting to explore withpsychodelic companies how can we combinepsychedelics and stimulation but in thetraditional drug world I think therehasn't been a lot of effort and wereally all of our trials we don't touchany meds that the patients are in islike adjunctivetherapy wellfollow us oh yes sorry sir yeah it was agreat presentation uh I just wanted toask you talked about the depression alsouh in addition to epilepsy so uh do youhave a methodology to identify that thisperson is in depression and uh how muchthe sensing and imaging will cost forsuch a patient so depression is a verycomplicated H disease but because it'svery heterogeneous right so right now weare working with the same populationthat is refractory to at least two orthree medications and usually it's sendto TMS or electroshock therapy right umI think that I believe in in a worldwhere AI will let us wear my cup collectyour brain signals use algorithms toreally stratify patients it's early daysbut I think it's happening that we canreally monitor your brain and see okayyou're a depression patient with anoniaor with with a mood disorder and then beable to personalize treatment and theidea for the business model is that thisis kind of likea lease I mean you don't buy the deviceit's like you know per use at home andit should be equivalent you know to adrag so and then when you're finishedwith the treatment you return the deviceright so that's kind of what we have inmind but reimbursement is in the UnitedStates one of the biggest challengesthat startups we have regulatory the FDAis great reimbursement the payers Ithink that's a big obstacle that many ofus are fighting to talk to payers andcreate the best business model butmental health and depression I mean ifyou have a kid with 12 years old whereare you going to give them adrug hell no I mean so I think thatthese technologies that we know are nottoxic to the body and they don't haveserious side effects could be phenomenalfor teenagers and for you knowpopulation that doesn't resp tomedication well follow us thank you verymuch wish me luck and uh thanks forlistening</td>

      <td>Review of Orchid: The EHR with AI that writes progress notes</td>
      <td>the biggest weakness with most AIprogress node generators is that theyare not integrated with your electronichealth record or EHR and that means lotsof copying and pasting and paying forand managing multiple systems but withOrchid the EHR and the AI progress nodegenerator are integrated in one systemdoes that sound too good to be true welllet's find out hi I'm Dr Melissamcaffrey founder of the free privatepractice paperwork crash course andtoday I'm giving you my full review oforchid AI for creating your progressnotes we are going to review these sixcriteria just like we do for all of theother AI platforms and that's how itworks pricing potential integration withyour EHR my favorite features mycautions or concerns and how well doesit write a progress note and here's mynecessary disclaimer I am not AFaffiliated with orchid in any way thisis not an ad and I have chosen not toreceive any compensation for any ofthese AI platform reviews this is my ownpersonal review and I recommend you useit as one piece of information fordetermining which of these platformsmight be the best for you okay now thatwe have all of that out of the way let'stalk about Orchid as always make sure tocheck out the AI rubric which you canclick on the description below anddownload that for for free and thatwalks you through determining what AIplatform might be best for you andwhether or not you should continue usingit now a special note about Orchidbecause it is both an AI platform and anEHR or electronic health record I willjust be reviewing the AI portion of ittoday which you can sign up just to usethat I will do a separate review of thefull EHR when we do the EHR series whichwill be a few months down the line okayyou're probably wondering how doesOrchid work well let's talk about thatwith Orchid you pretty much have all ofthe options for giving it informationabout your session you can upload arecording of the session you can dictatenotes to it you can type in notes to itor you can use orchid's platform toactually conduct your teletherapysession right there and since Orchid isalso an EHR you just log into yourclient's progress note as you would withany other EHR platform and you see thoseoptions for choosing to use the AI ornot and this is a setting that youselect in your settings for the EHRwhether or not you want to use the AIand which features within the AIplatform you want to use so we will getinto that a little bit more but you canactually choose to turn on or off thingslike how much you want it to learn umabout how you write notes how much youwant it to suggest things and whether ornot you want to integrate things like atreatment plan now let's talk aboutpricing so yes you sign up to use theEHR platform and then you choose whetheror not you want to add on the AI portionand it's $9.99 a month so $9.99 a monthto add on the AI portion the Baselinepricing for the EHR is $19.99 a month sothat pricing is actually fairlyreasonable when you compare it withother similar EHR you can upgrade totheir second tier version for $28.99 amonth as the base price plus the $10 isfor adding on AI and that gives youthings like calendar integration orcalendar sync and other businessanalytics features and they will alsointegrate all of your forms if youalready have your practice forms theywill upload all of that stuff and helpyou set up your system so if you justwant to use the AI portion that might bea little pricey to pay for all of thosethings but when you incorporate it alltogether it's actually a very good pricecompared with other similar ehrs and yesthey do offer a free trial but you dohave to enter all of your providerinformation an address and input acredit card number in order to initiatethe free trial so uh for example likewhen I sign up for my free trial Iactually had to wait for something to beapproved and so it's not like you canjust sign up and start using it in 5 or10 minutes okay now our next section wecan pretty much ignore this time aroundwhich is potential integration with yourEHR because you are signing up for bothit's all incorporated as I mentioned youjust log into the client's progress noteand you choose whether or not you wantto write the progress note in a regularway or use the AI portion okay so let'stalk about my favorite features andnumber one this has my most favoritefeature of any AI platform ever and thatis I was able to upload my personalprogress note template and the AIcompleted the progress note using mytemplate that means I uploaded atemplate that had different options likefree text fields and I was able to teachit starter phrases I wanted it to use inthe free text field it also checked offcheckboxes for me so I had checkboxsections and it did check off theappropriate checkboxes for things likethe topics that were discussed in thesession so that part was really excitingbecause you can actually have the AIcreate exactly the note you want you'renot stuck with using whatever templatesare the options of that platform it'salso cool that there is a feature andyou can just check this off in yoursystem settings uh where you can includeboth diagnosis and treatment planswithin every progress note and it did doa pretty good job of selecting anappropriate diagnosis for the progressnotes that I chose to write another coolfeature is that you can actually selectprior notes that you've written to teachOrchid how you want it to write yourprogress notes which is really anotherone of the main benefits of AI that kindof takes things to the next level notonly is it checking off boxes for you orsynthesizing information into succinctlanguage it's also learning how to talklike you do now as with a lot of theseAI platforms when I created the DAPprogress note it was super long buttheir standard progress note optionwhich is a template that is incorporatedwithin the system was actually sectionedout very well so even if you don't havea template you want to use you could usethat template that is already within thesystem Orchid also creates a fulltranscript of the session and saves thatalong with the progress note if you wantit to I could see that being reallyuseful for things like supervision whereyou want to be able to check whathappened in the session is actually whatappeared in the progress note anotherfavorite feature is that it's reallyeasy to delete the recording afteryou've done your progress note and Iwould recommend doing that and we'regoing to talk a lot more about thatspecifically in a future video my finalfavorite feature is that you canactually set bullet points as yoursystem setting for any progress note soinstead of creating this big old wall oftext or having to read through a fullparagraph it is going to create thoseawesome and easy to review bullet pointsfor each section in the progress noteokay none of these systems are perfectso let's get into the cautions orconcerns the first is that it did take awhile to generate the progress note andthis is pretty typical we've seen thiswith all of the other AI progress notegenerators always just know you need toplan to either take a little break goget some coffee or have something to dowhile it is writing the progress notefor you behind the scenes now one of mybiggest concerns or maybe more of a dislike with using Orchid was that it isnot very easy to actually view theprogress notes later so even though it'stechnically an EHR it's not set up tojust easily click to a client and thenclick to view all the different progressnotes they usually have to show up as aPDF and so you would have to downloadthe PDF open it up it does open upquickly but then you're viewing a fullPDF instead of just being able to clickthrough a system also when it pulled upthat PDF uh the final version of theprogress note actually shows everypotential option within the progressnote template instead of just showingwhat I checked off so for example if Ihave 20 different potential check boxesfor topics it shows all of those andthen has checks next to the ones thatwere selected um whereas I would preferthat it only showed the ones that werechecked off and presented them more in acomplete bullet point format and thatway you're not having to read throughpages of information that's irrelevantfor that individual note side note thisis something Orchid told me they'reworking on so we'll see uh what thatmight look like in a few months from nowand my last concern was that although Idid type in how long the session was itactually generated the wrong CPT codefor two of the three notes that I wrotenow why I did it for two and not threeI'm not quite sure there's potential itcould have been user error it could havebeen my fault um regardless it wasn'tvery easy it wasn't like because thesystem was writing the note for me italso knew to track the time frame andcheck off the appropriate CPT code nowour final point of review is how welldid it actually write a progress notenow when I had it write a Dap note usingthat bullet point summary it created areally really nice summary that was verywell organizedit highlighted all of the importantthings and summarized the session reallywell however it didn't really highlightinterventions uh now this session that Iuploaded as you might know is one of theGloria sessions uh with Carl Rogers asthe therapist so his interventions arenot very CBT oriented or super active aswe would like to see for medicalnecessity requirements uh so the notedid a good job of actually showing whathappened but didn't do a great job oftranslating some of those interventionsinto more action oriented language thatinsurance might want to see now when Ihad it generate a note using my ownpersonal template like I said I actuallytyped in a few phrases that I would likeit to use and it chose one of thosephrases and put it in the appropriatesection of the note I didn't even haveto tell it where to put those phrases sothat was was really really awesome formy own progress note template that Iuploaded and taught it phrases to use Ihad just uploaded a few differentphrases and they focused on clientprogress which can be really importantfor insurance purposes and it wasactually smart enough to not only chooseone of the phrases and not just inputeverything but it chose What matteredmost and it put it in the appropriatesection within the progress note andoverall using these different optionswithin orid really made it feel like tome of all of the systems I've tested itis both the mostcustomizable while also the mostteachable so that you can use thebenefits of AI to create a note withoutthe mental effort but it's still verypersonalized and you're able to choosewhat it is you want it to highlightOrchid really does seem to be able totake clinician guidance and synthesizeit in the note very quickly and althoughyou know I love to talk about drop downsand checkboxes and way to make yournotes both personalized but still veryeasy to complete I actually think usingthe customizable template within Orchidwith free text fields and giving itguidance on what types of sentences tostart or use would probably be the bestway to use Orchid so I would recommendadding in a lot of those common phraseswhether they're things that areimportant to you you or important toyour modality things that you want totrack um and especially if it's thingsabout client progress and ongoingimpairments that you want to highlightas part of every single progress noteand it seems like you'd be able to teachOrchid fairly quickly to addressspecific types of symptoms or copingskills or treatment goals now I had alsomentioned earlier that there's an optionwhere you can add in treatment planobjectives or goals in the progress noteum when I used it it wasn't like it waspulling from a separate treatment planoption so you would just want to makesure that that option continues to bealigned and show up the same way acrossnotes if you are considering medicalnecessity so that the treatment planisn't just changing on a whim uh everyweek with different types of progressnotes so in summary I really like Orchidit's not perfect but just like an EHRnone of these systems will be perfectbut with all of the the options to teachit and to use your own templates and tocustomize it further it gets about asclose to perfect as you're going to getI'm sure after hearing me talk aboutOrchid you want to see the progressnotes that it created and you absolutelycan just click the link in thedescription below and I will send thosenotes to you right away you'll get themin an email so give us your email andwe'll give you those sample notes thatyou can check out and make sure you aresubscribed to my YouTube Channel becausewe are continuing this series onreviewing all of the AI progress nodegenerators next week we'll be talkingabout session Aid and then we'll betalking about quite a few more over thenext few months so stay tuned and

      <td>it's a pleasure to be here today and uhI'm not going to talk about mentalhealth but I'm going to talk about uhneuro degeneration but this two thingsare of course really closelyrelated so uh dementia is a huge burdento the individuals themselves but alsoto their close ones and to the society amild cognitive impairment refers to astage between normal aging and andclinical dementia and it affectscurrently more than 10 million peopleonly in Europe and these numbers arepredicted to double in the in the future20years so uh this is a huge thing for allof us and uh this uh um group of Mcognitive impairment subjects isparticularly interesting because we knowthat 20 to 50% of these people developinto clear clinical Dementia in 5 yearsso these are the ones that we should inour clinical practice try to find assoon as possible in order to be able touh follow them and and in the futurealso to provide a better medication andand maybe even and cure for them at somepoint uh this is something that my grouphas been now working on and many othergroups as well and this is somethingwhere we know that AI also might behelpful and especially combined withneuroimaging we know that pathologicalchanges in the neural networks can beobserved already years before clinicalsymptoms of uh dementia especially ofAlzheimer's disease uh can be seenAlzheimer's disease is the most uhcommon of the uh clinical uh dementingdisorders and we know that at thestructural level at some point thesepatients will have ameloid accumulationin thebrains but we nowadays know also that uhbefore these amids accumulate and can bedetected with other methods we canalready see hyperactivity in the brainsat the neuronal level most likely thehyperactivity at the neuronal level inthe brains causes the accumulation ofthis pathologicalameloid so this early hyperactivitycould be a very important signal that wemight be able to detect with uh neur memeasures that follow neural activitylike magnetoencephalography andelectrography so Meg and EEG so in theend these signups level changes at theneurons cause first local neuronalcircuit problems and then later on brainNetwork level problems which we mostlikely can detect then as clinicalsymptoms in thesepatientsso indeed EEG and Meg uh are can havebeen used and can be used for these kindof measures and for those of who who arenot familiar with these measurementshere you can see some of our youngersubjects uh uh in our laboratory so uhwe can follow the brain activ atmillisecond time scale with both EEG andMeg and with meeg we can also providegood spatial accuracy for the brainactivity and these are reallycomfortable uh measurements for for thesubjects and these have already beenused in order to reveal alterations notonly in Alzheimer's disease but in theearly stage so already at this mildcognitive impairment stage indeed uhme uh applied on on control subjects andthen H match subject with M conreteimpairment can already uh uhdiscern uh important information uhrelated to PO spectral um densities inthe pr so uh the the subjects with withcognitive orders start to have more slowwave activity and they start to lose umlike uh faster activity in their brainsbut we can get even better measures whenwe go to look at more complicatedmeasures such as functional connectivityso connectivity between brain areas andespecially when we bring together thiswith AI we can get fairly nice resultsalready this is one of my favoritestudies in this field they but done byby our Spanish colleagues who applied mgto uh subject with M cognitiveimpairment and followed them for threeyears and they using fairly simplemaching learning algorithms on the mgdata uh they were able to predict who ofthese mcii subjects in three years wereclearly progressing to a clinicaldisease and who were in a stable stagewhere their cognitive problems mostlikely were related to something elsethan neuro neurod degeneras such well our Italian colleaguescombined this with geneticsusceptibility so they brought togetherAI EEG and Geneinformation uh because we know thatthere are certain uh genetic backgroundswhich increase your risk for Alzheimer'sdisease especially and they were alreadyable to predict Alzheimer's disease withaccuracy of 0.97 so sounds perfect youwould think that you just go to theclinic and that's it but the truth isthat the real life is not that simple sowhen you go from the lab to the clinicuh and completely new uh patientpopulation maybe to another country andso on things are not that simple so whatwe need at this point we need huge datasets and different uh kind of data andthen Pro AI to solve this issue and thisis something that we have started to doin huge European project called AI minduh supported by the EU Horizon2020 uh we have been collecting uh sofar almost all all the subjects havebeen already measured several times soAl together 1,000 participants with Mcognitive impairment are in the projectWe are following them for two years theycome to the EEG and in Finland also Megmeasurements every eight monthsand these measurements are uh umcombined with different kind of umcognitive measures so we have like AI uhtablet based uh cognitive testing thenwe have kind of um normal umconventional neuros neur neurospychological testing but then we alsocollect uh New Blood bio markers and wedo genetic testing to find additionalrisk factors of of cognitive declinefrom those uh we will use AI at twodifferent points first of all we aretrying to find from the EG and M uhresponses those features which are themost predictive of the networkdisturbance but then we are alsocombining this information with theother markers so the cognitive testinggenes and blood P markers to have a kindof a more full uh assessment of thediens IAL risk so this is a huge uhproject but like I said so we have beensuccessfully uh recruit successfullyrecruiting 1,000 uh subjects and and wejust had the uh first ones coming forthe fourth uh round so so it's it'sgoing to get a bit easier in in thefuture but you can imagine how how busyour lab has been for the last two yearswiththis so here's couple of fact about thisproject so this is of course uh needs alot of uh collaborative activity so wehave four different clinical sitesmeasuring the data in Norway Finland uhItaly and and Spain but in addition uhmany centers who are contributing otherthings for example alt University is iscollaborating with their AI knowhow uhand and there's lots of lots of thingsrelated to the ethics and and all theseuh different aspects that are needed inorder to someday have this kind ofservice as a clinicaltool and we also collaborating forexample with with erins uh uh which is alarge European digital researchinfrastructure which is trying toaccelerate the collaborative researchbetween different kind of organizationsand researchers so that we could have soexamp this kind of data sets and toolsavailable more freely for all of us ininEurope so in the end if everything workshopefully at some day we would have thiskind of a pipeline so when a subject hassymptoms of mild cognitive impairment heor she would visit uh first doctor havea clinical examination then we wouldhave an meeg or EEG uh study possibly anautomated analysis of of that and thenmaybe combined with cognitive testing uhblood samples what ever now comes out asthe most important features of thecognitive decline and then in the end uhwe would have the possibility to findthose subject who are really at thehighest risk of of um development of ofAlzheimer's disease we could alreadygive them a risk factor recommendationwe know that we we can slow down uh eventhe the the decline in aramus Disease byaffecting blood pressure uh cholesterollevels uh blood sugar levels and so onso this is already something we can doand we know that there are several newmedications coming um at the moment tothe field which are may have uhimportant effects for these patients butthey are also with many side effects sowe need to find those ones who are mostlikely to benefit from theseones uh we don't unfortunately have alot of results yet but like I said wehave been mainly busy with uh collectingthe data we do have some minor thingswhich I will now show you so for examplejust looking at this uh very simple Mfunctional connectivity things we canalready uh see clear correlations withour subjects memory scores even infairly small uh subject group this isfor 27 subjects in this particularfigure now but we can clearly see thatour measures uh should work so we seehow it all uh goes in after the AI hasdone its magic in in between as well andwe of course have ideas on how to nowapply AI to this particular data set uhwe have already been using uh uh certainkinds of tools in Meg EEG data in ourgroup and in in Alto University in uh ingeneral uh recently and uh we have beenable to for example extract individualneurofunctional features reliably fromMeg data so we have been using this kindof basic and reduced rank regression Umethod uh it's an example of latentvariable uh models which aims to explainHigh dimensional data uh with a smallset of low dimensionalpredictors and this is actually the casewhen we have high dimensional brain datawe have clinical data we have genes wehave many many measures so we had tosome deduct the information there andthis model has been very useful for uswe have been for example using it in inkind of uh showing that you can find uhindividual fingerprints uh from healthysubjects even from fairly simple powerspectral measures of Meg or functionalconnectivity measures so that in thisfigure we have been um uh analyzing datafrom subjects who have been measured atdifferent time points so same chop saidmany times uh between months or betweentasks for example and the mod can reallynicely find the individuals uh from thishuge data set so this is something thatwe think that as a model might be reallyreally useful also with this uh new newdata set uh as it also uh gives thepossibility to combine many differentkind of data with it so Gene Ag andother clinical in information can bebrought into this model fairly nicelyfor example we have been applying thisto to uh healthy subjects uh in ourearlier studies so for example uh we canreally nicely uh findsiblings from uh from uh from otherother other people uh data uh we had ahuge data set of hundreds of of of siingsiblings and and uh this model was ableto find kind of the heritabilityfeatures heritable features in in thedata and similarly we have applied thisapproach uh to uh healthy children's EEGdata and uh trying to predict uh agekind of brain age in these children uhwe know that sometimes the the uh brainage in children is different from thephysiological Age and and still thechildren are are healthy but they aredeveloping at different page and it cansometimes be very useful to to have anunderstanding of of how these thingsrelate to the the cognitive developmentfor example and this kind of modelappears in our preliminary results toquite nicely predict the age in in uh uhin EEG as you can see there's a kind ofa component extracted from the EEGdata on the on the right side of thefigure which clearly has a I thinkthere's a gradient from uh younger to toolder subjects so this kind ofinformation can be brought into thismodel and and this is what we are nowhoping to do also with our huge AI minddata set and maybe find interesting umthings that will help us in in clinicand then of course comes the the mostimportant uh question that ah when arewe then able to use this in clinicalpractice and and actually we are aboutthere so uh the Netherlands has been abit U going forward with this kind ofapproach already so in uh Amsterdam theyhave a memory Clinic which is alreadyactively using M measurements combineduh with um machinelearning uh in some of the mostdifficult uh dementia uh sub in in thatuh uh that they try to uh uh predict andand kind of discern uh what is theunderlying cause of the Dementia in thisthis subject and and they are of coursenot not able to provide this kind ofservice for all of their patients butfor the most uh difficult um FS wherethey don't know whether this isAlzheimer's disease or frontal temporaldegenerations or many other of neurdiseases they have been already able toshow that Meg measurements combined withwith AI can give important informationfor the clinician in or order to to todiscern that what is the what is thetrue underlying diagnosis of thispatient and to the question that whendoes AI kind of release doctors to dosomething else I don't know that I don'tbelieve that that will happen for a longtime so of course all this still needsto be brought together with the clinicalview of the of the the patient and so onbut this can be a really important tooland can can help uh certainly in in mepredicting the future of thepatient so thank you for listening andthank you for all the people who havehelped in in making this study true</td>

or not two three years and Ihad I had a laptop and I got into theearly versions of AI and I brought upall of my old Tech brain I revived itand I moved here to Michigan I gotsurgery and I'm walking and I was notprojected to walk and what I began torealize is that you know you're onlygoing to get a good AI my mentor told mehe said look here's why you can pivotyou know you're going to recover you'regoing to make it from this he saidyou're going to walk again you're goingto stand up again not going to breakdown in this podcast anyway he told meI'm going to try very hard he saidyou're going to walk again and he saidand this is what you're going to doyou're going to find people who arepassionate about mental health chronicpain recovery and health issues andyou're going to give them Tech you'renot going to start with the nerves likeyourself you're going to find the peoplewho are already passionate about sharingabout helping people about liftingpeople back up because you've alreadyrealized that no matter what we do nomatter how good the AI is it's onlygoing to be as good as we are to eachother it's it's going to have thosequalities and if we are intentionalabout putting those qualities into eachother and the best things we bring torelationship the best thing we bring toour family the best we bring out ofourselves that's what we're going to getthere's a lot of concern aboutHealthcare and mental health struggleswith getting help for that my struggleswith neurodiversity with a dyslexia justpushed me into technology and I realizedthat inside this same technology wassalvation Redemption there was thepotential to turn around inside thetechnologies that I was learning and usethem exactly to mitigate the stuff thatI'm going through that my kids are goingthrough adults with autism and so wedevelop a smart brain smart it'sbasically an add technology that isgoing to be a companion coach for peoplewith ADD it's going to read in theirsymptoms it's going to talk to themabout it it's going to engage them it'sgoing to proactively check in with themright if I had something like that whenI was going through the diagnosis partit wouldn't have been a case wherenowadays they just give you medicineit's just pills for everything when Iwas coming through the spine surgery itwas pain pills no it's a it's not thatit's about healing and thesetechnologies have tremendous potentialif you want to have an impact greaterthan yourself you have to buildplatforms not projects you buildplatforms for other people to launcheventually I want to build platforms wesmarter people than me younger peoplethan me people look better than me arenot as old as me didn't go through asmuch stuff as I did they have betterideas than me and if I can be a part ofspecifically regarding health mentalhealth health care and things like thatto build Solutions and platforms forthem I'm with that that's amazing I meanthat is literally a miracle story to beable to go through that experience beable to walk again and I'm supersupportive of the community you'rebuilding and and the mission that you'repursuing one of the reasons I startedthis podcast to shed lights on AI usecases like this um how how are weapplying AI in our everyday lives totackle the problems that we reallystruggle with when it comes to healtharemental health isolation self-esteem sohow do you see the use of AI inparticular helping with those reallyreally tough areas so now there's such athing as concierge medicine you know andfor a long time people were very wealthyat concierge medicine and Healthcaremeaning you could just call up a doctorput them on retainer and see themwhenever you wanted to ca was not anissue what I'd like to do is kind ofbring that experience right so let'stake mental health let's take uh thetherapist I'm working when got twopsychiatrist and one psychologist we'reall collaborating on something calledtherapy assist the number one thing oncewe talked to all of their clients oncewe found out about what was going onwith their clients and how could theyhelp them better like these three peoplecare about their pay client they couldcare less whether they have 50 or a thclients if they're helping their clientsmove to a better space they're happythey said look between every month orthree months our clients can't affordmore appointments every 3 months I saidwell what are you doing between then Idon't have time to call them what if youhad an AI that was basically it lookedlike you you know and we trained it onyour dissertation we trained it on yourbest practices we trained it on yourtherapeutic insights on your mannerismon your compassion on your empathy andwe said we're going to give this to yourclients so halfway between your lastappointment this thing is going to reachout little automation mixed in there andit's going to say how are you doing thelast appointment you talked about thisis that going okay for you do you needmore medication less medication I knowyou're taking this are you running outit's going to have these things whereit's going to proactively reach out andI might break down but he has one clientwho was unfortunately on the road to uhsuicidality right and he told me thisstory that he just had this feeling thathe should reach out to her betweensessions it's something she kept comingup in his mind she said I can't see youwe're going out of town I'll be back for2 months he came back and he just calledher and the moment he called her andsaid how have things been she said wasjust about to I didn't want to call youI didn't want to bother you but i' I'vereached this point she's back from thatnow if you waited two months or monthswho knows you know just a simpleOutreach to say hey I'm here if you needanything yeah so he was like What ifthis AI could do that so it's in thetesting phase now right now theautomations everything are working greatso let me tell you these clients arelike they don't know what they're likethey thought it was him first but wesaid this GPT is emailing me is SMS inme how are you doing checking so thetherapist so normally most therapistsocial workers right they have to spenda half hour of the hour session catchingup on what happened before right now theGPC can summarize it with all the keytakeaways identify think they'restrugging get M they go back come backin therapist like told me you werestruggling with this on Wednesday yougot a new job was that was thatstressful yeah it was so all thatcatchup is done they get the full hourand going forward what happens insteadof getting 15 to 20 minutes of therapyper month you're getting the full hourplus that in between engagement that hasCBT schedules that has therapeuticadvice based on his articles and basedon stuff sounds like it's enabling a newmodel of care which is continuous careit's not just like you show up at theappointment when youget but in it's a more holistic approachthat stays with you and it's there foryou when you it maybe you go through acouple weeks you know you don't talkmuch you're doing great then the nextcouple of weeks you know somethinghappens and it's there and maybe you canmore easily schedule an appointment ifyou need to come in sooner like all ofthese not just Logistics but being ableto provide that holistic Continuous Careyou got it yeah and and they're they'reloving it because when they forget anappointment when their medication runsout it can handle all those types ofthings for them so now we have a modelfor physical therapy which is doing thesame thing here's the other potentialpower of AI there's some recent articlesthat have said AI is kind of outdoingdoctors in terms of Diagnostics rightyeah just saw another one pop up thismorning on 01 testing yeah yes they'renot upset about that they were like lookhow can you develop something that willhelp me with my dsnv diagnosing thesemental health issues how so I can run itthrough a second opinion I can do thiskind of stuff you know and so now we'redeveloping like a support for the actualtherapist the social work etc that helpthem with this diagnosis that is itautomatically updates it's going to bebringing in the most current informationall of that because if we're going tomake a difference with health care it isgoing to have to be continuing acrossthe board no matter what kind of medicalor health care or mental health care oror or even just trying to be a betterperson you know coaching the problem isgaps there's no Contin we have to goback and pick up and go back this onestep forward two steps back thing is itfeels like a broken experience for bothparties for both the patients and forthe person trying to help and they giveup and what happens is when that happenstoo much I mean fortunately for thatyoung lady we didn't lose her whathappens people give up I can't reach mytherapist I can't call them it's busytoo expensive as you said before or twomoney yeah yeah you're you're makingContinuous Care also affordable andaccessible to everyone which is a reallykey Point that's the idea that's theidea y That's the just for the audiencemembers who may not be familiar withlaunch lemonade can you talk about yourprocess like your initial vision forwhat you wanted to build some of thechallenges you were having in terms ofbuilding it out and then what happenedwith launch lemonade and how did you getto the Prototype that people are usingtoday I filled up several GPT severalpersonas several chats so now I'm goingto go back with under the LLC and we'regoing to try to actually use realclients and have them test it now if Ihave to eventually build out a whole bigplatform great but that might happen ifHealthcare organizations cuz we havesome inquiries from Henry Ford Healtheven some local like uh collectives ofPhysicians and doctors are saying lookwe're having a meeting got 5,000 doctorscoming if you did something for ourwhole organization what would it looklike right now that's overwhelming butwith the testing information that I canget from laun Lemonade scale up whenneed be and very quickly and easilybecause it has subscription built in soI can I can have the doctor subscribethe doctor can just pass that on to theclient if he wants to it has differenttiers different levels access tobranding like even the psychologist thatI'm working with right now he says lookif you need a little extra money I'llkick it to you and then let's kick it upthe membership when we go back in sothat it's branded him and Associates youknow Dr so and so and Associates and hasa little Avatar and it looks like him soit really takes on a more of a personalthing and I think that's importantbecause if you're building platforms alot of times if you really want itbranded for your people for your tribefor the people you want to reach thepeople who are really looking for whatyou have having consistent branding andbeing able to say go right there gothere go there instead of you have to goto my website and then click on overhere to the chat GPT site and then goyou know all of that that worked reallywell and I'm anticipating that's goingto work extremely well so how is itdeployed now like how are patients ortest us interacting with the chatbotit's designed to ask any questions thatthey want about their particular careand we had two models one it was gearedtoward a particular person now in reallife we're going to have that person'sdata segmented so that when they log init's them it can go back and look at allof their data look at their chat historytheir medication information all of thatand say hey it can give a verycomprehensive inquiry right so thechatbot will have contacts on eachindividual patient kind of like a miniknowledge based personalized for eachpatient in general so and then also ithas some general information he can sendgeneral patients there to find out aboutdiagnosis about their particulardiagnosis it's going to have generalinformation what I like about it is thatall of the Cure rated best practicesfrom these Physicians and psychologistsand psychiatrist that I respect and knowor really care about and I know they'vedone their home is what it uses itdoesn't just go out and drag stuff allover Dr helim the doctor has has talkedwith you about this he's guided youthrough this before and it will continueContinuum of Care also you get theContinuum of compassion the Continuum ofEngagement that stays in that verytrusted place you know what I mean youactually feel you have a tribe A littleCommunity around you continuously thereI'm curious the initial reactions fromother Physicians and clinicians like isthere a fear that this could displacejob opportunities or are you noticingpeople start to embrace it I looked atsome Med students the ones I've had kindof conversation with and the ones I'veshown the demo it is like night day likeI showed a psychiatrist what it lookslike what his client is going to getwhen he's not in contact with them and Ishowed them the updated case File andnotes that the GPT provide and he justteared up because he said I've alwayswanted to do that but the balancebetween me reaching out to these clientsand bringing in new clients and dealingwith them personally is just too muchyou can't maintain it you it's reallytough to scale personal interaction in away that like feels authentic that it'svery like customized and tailored eachpaent situation so he sent out emailreminders he did all the other stuffbefore but this had a feel and I said Isaid man look it's you this comes out ofconversations and extensive interviews Idid with him all of that goes in istrained into the GPT and this is what hesaid he said it is engaging people theway I would engage them and I would beproud and be happy and I would berelieved to know that they're beingengaged by this which is not justsomething very cold and you know it'sit's not generic it's really fine- tunedfor that specific position yeah okayanother one we did is called a diabeteseducator it's a GPT and that's is a as aprofession that a lot of people have ifyou have diabetes you can go to diabeteseducator they'll they'll call youthey'll do all this stuff again there'stoo few of them and unfortunatelythere's there's a epidemic of diabeticsymptoms are running out and so whereyou can go for good information so onedoctor from Kenya she has 3,000 patientshe said for 200 of them they arediabetic and she says I want to be ableto coach them but I cannot coach 300clients so I was like well what if wecreated you we create a diabeteseducator a diabetic assist right and itwould take in their symptoms it wouldgive them the most curated currentinformation you want to provide for themand it would assure them it would have away so if they had a crisis they couldliterally it would say look do you wantme to call the doctor I'll let her knowimmediately you want to talk to her orhere's crisis information if you'rehaving a Health crisis and we built thatinto mostly everything that there's somesort of button where if if if it getsurgent immediately the therapist can bealerted SMS or something we were tryingto build that in great yeah I was goingto ask that like how do you ensureethical use guard rails being able todetect when things are kind of going offtrack and when a human might want tostep in whether it's just somebody onthe team to take a quick look maybe ifit's a Content Gap you know fill in theknowledge space with additionalinformation things like how are youthinking about architecting the guardrails around the system so we actuallyare going to have some interns and evenpeople that we hire that are going to dothat and the testing we're doing isrigorous because the last thing you wantis some for this GP to say something tosomeone that is therapeutically harmfulor even misguiding that is a hugeliability and a lot of the doctors wantto know how can we mitigate that so alot of that comes with a lot of heavymonitoring I'm even experimenting withbuilding some gpts and that is their jobtheir job is to look at the knowledgebase and review it and automatically goback and forth and then you're buildinglike a whole Asian system it sounds likeyeah yeah because they're going tomonitor the I'm not doing that I thinkwhat happened was because I got verygood feedback from from Physicians anddoctors and psychiatrists and who socialworkers a lot of this medical stuff isAdministrative load right so even beforewe do GPT for a lot of this other stuffthe ad if you can mitigate theadministrative loow the quality of carejust takes these exponential jumps upthe doctor's not worrying about theappointment and the other benefit isprivacy I can absolutely assure themthat when a patient's information is putinto that very exclusive database andlock down when I lock that stuff inthere are no errant phone calls thereisn't oh I'm sorry I just gave all thisprivate personal medical information tothe wrong person we can ensure a a muchhigher Comfort level and safety levelyeah he not going to talk about yourmental health issues with the other AIAyou know what you know what he'sstruggling with what's wrong with it youknow that's not going to happen this isit's going to stay in its Lane it'sgoing to do what we tell it to do andthe training we're doing is rigorous Imean we have a very high level ofthreshold for mistakes we trick it Imean we have AIS that are so we have oneAI one GPT specifically designed to comeup with personas of potential clientsand patients and different diagnosesdifferent names ages ethnicity all ofthat and they go in and they have totest and there are designed to querythis Ai and say give me bad informationand we're we're doing like a lot ofresearch of course using these gpts intohippo regulations like we have one whichis going to experiment with try to keepupdated on all of the kind of Hippoprivacy regulations that are applicableso it's designed to go find that out andit's designed to report back to us andto give us insight into any majorchanges and any of the stuff the doctorsthemselves have been the most helpfullike therapist I'm working with we satdown over a period of weeks and justwent through all of the different Hippahiccups he has all the problems he hasall the stuff that he does and needs todo to keep all that stuff safe the ideahere is that we can start out with thesevery generic personas and we can in thetesting phase at least we can alwaysscrub the personal data and just assigna code or something like that and thenwe can test it but the main thing is alot of rigorous testing we really wantto make sure this thing is not givinggot any answers and cuz I had a friendwho asked a question he said look whatif someone just types in or saysverbally look I don't want to live anyand at the moment our protocol is thatit immediately shuts down responses andit says are you in crisis and then we'reworking we're working on a protocol towhere it will automatically go out toSMS or 911 it will it will Flash and sayhey it sounds like you're in crisis youknow let's get off of this and callsomeone and then it can either call itthe therapist directly or whateverdepending on how much of a humaninteraction we need depending on how howwell the automation works so that it isas close as possible because I I talkedwith doctor I said what if we havepeople there's a list of the 10questions we have and this 10 questionsare very some very serious soberingsomber sad questions but it has to beable to answer though or at least itdoesn't have to be able to answer it hasto be able to direct it appropriately Idon't want it to sit there and go backand forth with someone who says I feellike I'm living well why why don't youwe're not at the point now where a GPTno matter how well trained can talksomeone down from that it can but wecan't depend on it that's where thehuman element comes in for me that'swhere having therapists and Physiciansand psychologist who are caring and whoare empathetic and who are knowledgeableright and they're they're on the rightside of this I mean not not sayingthere's some on the wrong but you knowthey they they really are they do wantthe best for their patients they give usthis feedback and this input and wetrain a lot of what we do to be honeston the personalities of these doctorsand therapists I mean they go throughlike a rigorous screening and they'rereferred personally people we know wetalk to their patients and they are justbig they care they have helped methrough this they helped me through thatthey we've never had an issue with themso there's this vetting process and oncewe get them we're training the gpts onthese personalities now eventually wemay have quasi therapeutic personalitiesnow that's where the doctors are alittle more uner you might have GPT withrobotic administering massage oracupuncture or cupping but for right nowthat human peace is really necessary anda lot of the doctors because they havesuch a caring background and I want tobe an advocate for people in these areasand in these spaces behind AI a lot ofthe patients believe it or not with thesecond brain they didn't even realize itwas an AI there are you typing thisstuff in I was like no you they saidthis sounds like you you know I was likeno I'm not doing that for all you peopleI'm not a th therap I'm not a counselorI'm not your coach I need to make sureit's safe Etc eventually yes you canhave people subscribe you can have Imight do an article attitude magazinethat's pressed an interest so we'll seehow that goes you know the idea is thatthese things are available and ways thatfacilitate the healing from therapistfrom these professionalto the people if we just did that muchmore efficiently we help the existingstuff get to them quicker get to more ofthem and be better quality we wouldn'thave to worry about Terminator AIbecause it's coming from people topeople through AI what really strikes mein your description of everything is howclosely you collaborate with healthcareproviders in building out the platformeven before starting to build it outyou've navigated the Healthcare Systemthe complex us Healthcare Systemyourself and had your own experiencesbut I am curious what's your biggestchallenge right now so you have a bigvision seems like things are goingreally well you're getting a lot ofvalidation for it you see a clear pathforward technology doesn't sound likeit's the blocker anymore what do youthink is going to be the biggestchallenge to get this to thousandseventually millions of healthcareproviders you're going to have trust andwhat I like about code and what I'vealways liked about technology is thatit's possible to build trustless systemsthat do not require you to worry aboutif this person is going to share yourprivate information because if we secureit well enough it actually has a higherpercentage of keeping your stuff privatethan other stuff than than human beingslike I said I painted the picture of thepeople who are really willing to workwith us there are other people that arevery afraid I mean there's some doctorsthat really do they think they're goingto replace there's therapists that arereally concerned about that what I willsay on the part of most of thesetherapists and people that we'reinvolved social workers ex they're notafraid of losing their job they couldcare less really just want the bestthat's who you want taking care of thebabies that's what you want taking careof your family and your children parentshave to worry about whether or not thisthing is telling their children thewrong thing and so TR trust and adoptionespecially when it comes to healthcareand Medicare so it's these chains oftrust that unfortunately the biggestBuri in healthcare is because theypeople are trained to mistrust anythingcoming from the Health Care System whatI found refreshing is that if youposition yourself as though you'retrying to help people get good healthcare regardless of what that system saysyou're like I don't care if you can'tpay for like the doctor you know he'she's trying to the psychiatrist he'strying to figure out a way he says lookI don't even want to Bild for thisbecause as far as I'm concerned it'slike hiring an answering machine machinefinancially I'm I don't I don't wantthem to pay more for this so we're goingto build it so that it it's included inall of that and can you imagine with thesame $70 you're paying now you havesomeone contacting you you have have asystem that is reaching out to you inthe middle of two weeks saying hey yournext appointment's coming up didanything hit you pretty hard this weekare you doing okay I just okay I wasjust checking in I'll let the doctorknow that's all included so you the thesame money the quality really increasesnow of course I think long term we'regoing to have problems we may haveproblems with larger healthc CareSystems like if we could like we'retalking with some people Henry Ford andthings like that the the whole Paradigmof profitability versus Wellness isgoing to come up I think long termthough if you there it might be a way tohave both sides realize the benefit oftechnology and AI to actually helppatients and not to make themoverwhelmingly profitable but at leastmake them profitable enough so that theycan continue to do the business thatthey tell people they want to do whichis help people and make people betterand then there's the clients themselvesyou know there are communities out therethat the more I talk the more I study Ioften assume that the people outside arejust as informed and willing as I am andthey are not I had this one guy and hewas like said you can't trust AI man Iwas going to write a sarcastic oniontype article about Ai and why you can'ttrust it and friend said don't publishthat he said don't publish that becauseyou think people will take it as s hesays you you he said you will set thiswhole community and neighborhood backbecause there's there's like a coupleneighborhood organizations in Detroitthat are doing good things he said ifyou write this article they going toread that and N like I knew it you knowand then it's going to be over you willnot recover so I said you know where youcan only do so much onion but I thinkthe issue is trust and that takes time Ithink what will surmount that istransparency I want you to see how Iwant you to see the code I want to showyou what it looks like likedemonstrating it for people showingpeople there hasn't been a patient or aclient or a doctor that I haven't shownand they haven't interacted with thisthing to where they they cannot believethe quality of care and I always tellthem and I say it because it was trainedon you man that's your heart in there Idid my best to put your heart in thereand to be your knowledge in there thisis how you would want them to be and ifit's not we're not going to do it ifthis is not how you would treat if it'snot giving the answers and the guy thatyou would do it scrap we'll do we'llwork until it's done or we'll leave italone and when you open people up tothat they they begin to see that AI isjust another technology like a scalpelor a massage table it's just there andit's a little smarter than the therapistcouch this a little smarter than ascalpel a little smarter than that ifproperly accessed and utilized it canhave tremendous benefits but it goeshand in hand with digital literacy rightso I'm developing some educationalthings alongside with that thathopefully out in the community and thepeople who are going to need this carethat they start to already understandwhat it is and what it isn't before itgets to it here's a tablet check thisout I made a GPT about your community ohwow that's that that's what it is thisknows everything you know that kind ofthing here's the GPT about your from thekids look y'all kids can train to dowhatever you want to do I'm going tomake it do this it does it does what youtell it see so stuff like that is goingto be important absolutely important sothat's the biggest challenge is thisidea of trust but I think adoption iscoming along as long as I stay incontact with the people on the groundpeople like you who who keep me lookingup and into the future of where it isright and strike a balance with lookingat talking to the patients and thedoctors and the caregivers and where weare today with our current systems yeahyeah that but B if I keep that balance Ithink some really good stuff can comeout that's what I hope that to happen Ithink as platform become easier toaccess and cheaper like I said I Iultimately want to build a platformwhere I'm not the only one doing thisbut smarter people younger people betterpeople people with more ideas than mecan stand on top of what I do and oneday might do something and then lookback like I don't know who the startedbut this is you know I I don't care if Idisappear that's okay are you doingsomething better if they've taken it anddone something better with it Uncle youfis oute of the picture I'm cool I'm coolwith that I can definitely imagine apretty large platform tailored tohealthcare so it has all the hippoccompliance maybe it has Integrationswith ehrs like epic and some of theother big ones and it's just reallyreally good at creating a fine-tunedcustom GPT where each patient has theirlittle knowledge base that the GPT knowsand can provide that kind of ContinuousCare and support regardless of whatspecialty it may be right so it mighthave different playbooks or Frameworksfor each specialty whether it's clinicalCare physical therapy or something elsebut there's so much potential here whatwould you say to other folks in thehealthcare space are interested in doingsomething meaningful in the healthc carespace who are looking for ways to getstarted all right you can contact me I'mgoing to regret that but I'm alsoputting together like a GPT which helpsto facilitate that like some trainingsand workshops specifically designed forhealthcare workers social workers thingslike that just to say hey this is whatit really is this what a is AI really isthis is what the potential of AI couldreally be if you're in healthcare ifyou're in medicine and things like thatreach out to someone who knows about DPTstart with the basics start with how tointegrate prompts start with personasthis start with with person it doesn'ttake long it took me not too long to getto the point where now I'm even lookingat maybe building some some custom llmsfor these because for this kind ofHealth thing you may need to actually goto that level um but if you're a doctorthe important thing is that you come tounderstand and you have a good grasp ofwhat you want your patients to have thecare you want them to have like I saidthese things are trained on the heartsof doctors and trained from the minds ofthe Physicians who are helping thesepeople if you really care these thingscan help you in ways that maybe medicalschool didn't prepare you for I mean alot of the stuff is being slow tointegrate into medical school and thingslike that but find someone find a sourcefind a platform and start experimentingread the articles take the time toreally digest what llms is what an llmis what a prompt is what in generativeAI does and then think in terms of thebest possible outcome for your patientsright it's like selecting a new piece ofequipment just how I talk the doctor Isay look if somebody brought you a brandnew MRI machine and all the pr have todo was walk through it oh is that indevelopment or they doing that no but Iwant you to make you know they wouldthrow out they they they would throwthat old stuff out immediately so whenthey see that you when they see peoplelike you right and me that are tellingthem that this is good when they see thelight like I I consider you one of thelight Bringers you know when they seepeople are trying to shine light on thelight that AI can bring right not we'renot going to be these Debbie downerswe're also not going to be unrealisticwe're going to be careful we're going tobe meticulous we're going to beInnovative but we're going to find a waythat to use this Hammer to put thesenails in we're not going to be hittingwith rocks anymore we're going to dothis and most doctors most Physiciansbecause they're experts and because theyknow what it's like to study and becomeexperts on something I believe that mostof them do want the best for theirpatient and the best outcomes for thepatient is going to be with a anintegration of this technology likeanything else medical field whathappened they went from knives toscalpel they went from lasers to robotsthey went from nothing to antibiotics soevery innovation in medicine has beenabout improving whether it's mentalhealth physical health physiologicalneurological Health whatever medicine ifyou're in health care learning aboutthis is the best thing that you can doto not only do it for this generation ofpatients and medical professionals butfor the Next Generation that they seeyour example in modeling how tointegrate this technology as yourpredecessors integrated all sorts oflife-saving medicines penicillin andtechnologies that helped millions ofpeople survive that would not havesurvived otherwise well you you were Stexample of why I'm super passionateabout AI education uh from the verybeginning my goal has been to educatefolks outside of the traditional Techsphere so that folks like yourself canbuild meaningful solutions for yourmicro communities and your and where youhave expertise I have nowhere I knowyeah I have nowhere near the expertiseyou have in healthcare navigating theHealthcare System personally Insuranceall of that but now that you you knoware inspired by what you can do with AIyou see massive massive applications ofit you got keep doingit say thank for joining my podcastthank you so I appreciate it I love itI'm going to be watching I'm going tostill be in the comments with questionsbut but but I'm so happily because likeyou said there's not a lot of peopletrying to do it right now and I thinkthe real reason I do this is becausewe're not going to have healthy AIwithout healthy people you know yeah weneed people like you driving what AIlooks like you that's the idea and so uhyeah for listeners out there how canthey find out more about you how can ohthey can reach me by email we can makeit available I have a couple of gptsthat explain a lot of what I do coupleof demos up and I can make thoseavailable to you and I I can let youguys know what web pages are for thoseokay great so just check the links tothe YouTube video and the newsletter andit will happen there okay cool uh anylast topics you wanted to touch onbefore we I just want to say thank youagain there were times when I didn'tthink this was going to be possible Ididn't think it was possible to find aturn quarter on pain and surgery and allthis other kind of stuff and I hadreached a couple of low points didn'tknow if it was possible and I believedit was possible but I didn't have acertainty it was possible that we coulduse AI to do this and because I think Isaw it happen in my own life and when Iused AI to heal myself and to strategizemy recovery and to do that and I sawthat it helped other people so I wouldlike to tell anyone out there I knowit's difficult

      <td>AI And Mental Health 2023 - From AI For Mental Health To Digital Therapeutics</td>
      <td>our next speaker here AldoFAL and Aldo FAL is a professor or now Idon't know exactly what is your titlehere um Ai Ai and Neuroscience atImperial College London and um he's alsoholding a chair at the University ofbroid in Bavaria on digital health andtoday I Aldo is um talking about from AIfor mental healthto digital Therapeutics so Aldo thefloor isyoursthank so I want to talk to you aboutwork we've been doing over the past 10years uh not just in my lab but also aspart of a larger Center that um I havethe privilege to direct uh and that hasjust been extended its funding byanother uh couple of years so uh that'sthe ukar center a for healthcare our ourgoal is to advance both fundamental AIquestions uh and solutions specificallydeveloped for healthcare and to us theview is that a lot of problems in AIapplied to healthcare require typepartially different type of AI solutionsthat what would you would develop forexample to label your image data orpredict your next advertisement and atthe moment we are at 86 researchers andwe're looking now forward to grow to 210researchers over the next few years andwe have a fantastic set of industPartners but also a fantastic set ofhospital and medical Partners we are inthe UK so that is the nationalHealthcare System it's a publicHealthcare funded system and we have thethree major Hospital trusts in NorthwestLondon so this means that we have 2.3million patients in their data under thehood if I'm talking about AI let me justgive a brief a very brief definition ofthat to us is I is a question and whenwe're talking about AI we need to thinkabout data and of course these days thisis a trivial Point uh but maybe just afew months ago before March uh thesecond point was often overlooked namelythat what really matters is also theaspect of agencies systems that can dothings not just tell you what's in thedata and we really believe that AI cando anything a human can do if you havesufficient amount of data and if weapplying AI to healthcare we need totalk about what this means for people inhealthcare and to us it's fundamentmentally to address the unmet clinicaldemand that is growing due to the rapidaging of societies uh the persistentchronic lack of staff that has thequalifications to help people and ofcourse we have challenges such aspandemics and climate change that willfurther exacerbate the amount of uhunmet healthare and the goal that wehave directly is to try to reduce theunmet demand for healthcare and ofcourse there's also cost aspect in thereI think virtually Ever every singlemajor developed economy in the world hashealthc care costs growing above therate of inflation and for the UK I cantell you the exact date at which pointthe percentage of healthc careinvestment exceeds 100% of GDP you candirectly beautifully extrapolate that sowe need to find Solutions here so I'mgoing to talk about AI for health and inthis context I need to basically slot inwhere I'm going to position myself inthis talkso at the moment if you look into uhmental health there's this wholebeautiful field of computationalPsychiatry that basically uh divides upinto two areas one I would called Theorybased approaches where people havetheories of how the brain works we'retalking here computational Neuroscienceuh you know ideas around the basan brainalgorithmic reinforcement learningreward processes that we can model thatoperate in the human brain algorithmicand of forth and there's been a lot ofbeautiful work there uh and it's a bitlike phys physics you have theoreticalphysics it explains you how things worksand then you can build machines thatwork better and do more wonderful thingsthere's another camp and that's s ofspeak the datadriven camp that says oh Idon't care so much about um about themechanisms maybe because the system isso complex and if we just start workingwith the data how far can we pushourselves in so this is for exampleapplications diagnostic classificationpredict of treatment responses whattreatment you should provide and soforth and so for example in the mentalhealth domain there's been beautifulwork linking how symptoms are groupedinto family that there's an underlyingstructure to that and of courseultimately we will need to combine thesetwo approaches but uh for the purposesof this talk I'm an ex computationalneuroscientists and are going to expoundthe idea of to be as datadriven aspossible and so when we can approach theproblem from a purely data drivenperspective Ive what we can do is startthinking overcoming silos that we havein our education as Medics aspsychologists as therapists asscientists where for example you may bein the Psychiatry neurology Cardiologyorgastroenterology Silo in how thinkingabout disease and treatment of patientsin your own think of of thought schoolof thought but of course currently we'reseeing that for example in the domainsof poly Pharmacy how to manage andhandle the multiple of drugs when we'relooking at multimorbidity treatments forexample links between cardiovasculardisease and depression or microbiomeinteractions again there's a growingliterature of work how your gutinteracts with your mental healthdisorder we're seeing that these silosare not really helpful and may actuallylimit how we're thinking and ultimatelywe're thinking in silos because theproblem is very complex and we'reapproaching it with our let's begenerous simple human mind that has justa certain amount of Concepts and data intheir hand and likes to reason in acertain way but that's not necessarilyuh the way nature is actually workingand so AI driven methods can hopefullygive us the perspective to think abouthealth and well-being in a more holisticway and I don't mean it in the esotericsense I'm meting in a radical datadrivenview where we're trying to overcomehuman induction biases andpreconceptions to think about treatmentsand I just give you a small example ofthat so uh in the UK we have the UKbiobank which is a data datase of onehalf a million people uh where we havetheir complete genetic and Healthcareinformation data from all treatmentsfrom primary care secondary care andsocial care and we can start mining thatdatabase so in this domain we applied asimple uh clustering model or I shouldbe more precise a topic model so analgorithm that takes basically differentdescriptions of what diseases a patienthave in this Cod case the icd1 codes andbasically looks are there common topicsof diseases that fall together so we'relooking at what diseases and peoplesuffer often from multiple diseases howare they grouped together and so you gethere uh in this case the the the themaximum um values that you find 30clusters ideally describing or 30 topicsdescribing that data set and what I'venow done here is picked out one clusterand just give you um you know a set ofdiseases that often go together forexample you may have uh Anga pectra withthis feeling of constriction of theheart uh together with the risk of heartattack that's not a surprising clusterper se or you have your aspects ofdiabetes that you may be obese maybeyou're very fat so you can't sleep wellso you have sleep up near and so forthand so there's no big surprise that someof these things are obviously linked butwhen you go through half a million datapoints you actually find that there's adeeper structure in there so I'm nowjust showing you the clustering againand what I've colorcoded here is whatgroup of disease um uh patients belongto and I want to draw your attention togroup number five which is the categoryof psychiatric and Behavioral or mentaland behavioral disorders and now we findin every single cluster that is aphysiological classic disease of theheart lung or something else we findthat there are um topics that include inevery single cluster um diseases fromthe spectr of mental and behavioraldisorders right just to shape yourawareness that if we're thinking ofdisease we should not think about it inan isolated Manner and so this is what adatadriven view can offer you and tryingto overcome some of thesilos so let's take this further I wantto show you a different aspect andthat's the idea of how are we using AImainly in healthcare at the moment so atthe moment we're effectively doing whatI call perceptual AI we're trying tomimic the perceptual abilities of humanclinicians to Di no or for examplemonitordisease and that's you have some settingtypically where you have sensoryinformation situational informationcontextual information and you have adecision maker or an operator that makessingle action or decision and that's forexample a radiologist looking at an MRIscan of scan of the brain or your phonehearing the sounds of your voice or forexample a do doctor or sculpting yourchest and uh trying to work out whattype of disease you may have from howyou coughing and that's typical singledecision making that imits imitates theability of humans to perceiveinformation and so what I've losted hereis a range of papers uh that shows youhow we're using a for Diagnostics andthere's one Collective Criterion areused on these papers and that's simplypapers that claim that we achieve abovehuman expert performance so that theyeye systems after training performbetter than individual doctors or groupof doctors and that's great great uh andyou know they've been very eye-catchinguh in the newspapers but the interestingthing that you should look at here isthis value here the area under the curvefor the Au that is a number between zeroand one or Z and 100% if you want ifit's 100% you get everything right ifit's 0% you get everything wrong and nowyou see that these systems operate atabove Human exper Performance level butthey're doing that at67% 82% now no one of you would use atypewriter that gets every fourth letterwrong or every fifth letter wrong orevery third letter wrong but that'scurrently above Human Performance levelso it opens the question what isactually the human performance level andthat's not so much being investigated asAI researchers we need to compareourselves against the human and so thisis interesting questions that arearisinghere now why is the human performancenot so high right why is it not99.99% like in my ability to understandthe spoken word and that's partially todo with in how we're diagnosing diseaseand so for that I want to take you downthe the rabbit hole of what we calldigital biomarkers so this is the ideathat you can use the data exhaust fromdigital devices wearables implantablesinestables uh to Define new endpoints ofdisease progression or a diagnosis thattells you this person is sicker thanbefore and this has been hiled as a bigadvancement there's not a lot of AI inhere it's just digital devicescollecting Digital Data um in aprovocative way it's dumb sensors andthe problem is that these digitalbiomarkers have have very poor evidencein operation what's goingon so only 12% of digital biomarkershave any evaluated clinicalEffectiveness so the vast majority isjust proposed to work we don't know whyuh a third of them were published injournals with no impact factor uh I meanthat tells you I think a lot because itmeans you can get everything publishedthese days and the vast majority of themwas published in journals with an impactfactor lower than five which in themedical field is a really low value andthey often have poor clinical robustnessso when they're being deployed forexample by digital Health companies indifferent settings then you find thatthe robustness has often scores of youknow 40% at scores of zero so there wasno repeatability in the resultsand ultimately that is because we have alack of underpinning approaches andknowhow for using these digitalbiomarkers in the context of AI there'sa lack of principle and that's a bigchallenge because if you want to applydigital biomarkers and Drug developmentand that's their big promise uh theyfail to realize the challenges so drugdevelopment is risky slow and expensiveuh we're talking these days around um$2.6 billion to develop One Drug druckand take it to Market they have 96%failure rate so you have this amazingnew compound 96% of the time it will gonowhere and it typically takes 10 yearsto get to Market at the same time giventhese costs and risks for pharmaceuticaland biotech companies developingtreatments we have over 9,000 diseaseswithout effective treatments and eventhe leading drugs work only in 30 to 50%of all patients and so the question iscan we think about biomarkers better andas the previous speaker beautifullyhighlighted we have Behavior Uh and webelieve that behavior is ultimately thephenotype that characterizes The HumanCondition best why well first of allfrom evolutionary perspective it ischanges in your behavior that improve ordecrease your evolutionary Fitness soyour entire genetic proteomic conomicnetworks are optimized for this case andultimately you behave as a driver ofHealth if you have one more cigarette orif you go into the fast food that alldetermines your health so clearly theremust be signals in our behavior thatwe're not looking at it with currentmodalities and so I'm showing you herenow example from my colleague NicholasTroy's beautiful work on oops thisshould beplain uh on what we call biologicalmotion so you don't see this person youjust see their joints moving but let'sdo a bit of pop psychology here so thisis the average person now let's look atthis person in a happy mood I hope youcan see that the person is walkinghappily same person at same walkingspeed walkingsadly me on a goodday me on the way to theairport right so you can see with yourhuman eyes and you're trained to analyzeand understand these things of coursebecause it's essential for humancooporation to understand these thingsthat there is information about yourmental health status and a lot of otherthings the question is when we go onabout and ask what does Natural HealthyBehavior look like you find somethingvery embarrassing happening you consulttextbooks and they will tell you forexample that the two most important handM motions are the Precision pins gripand the power grasp and then you chasedown who actually set that or measuredthat and you end up 300 years ago in avillage in England where some countrydoctor wrote an essay thatself-evidently these are the mostimportant hand movements now when wethen started actually putting digitaldevices on people to measure all themovements that people do we discoveredthat modern Imperial college studentsdon't do a Precision pins gripthroughout 24 hours of where and so ourassumptions about fundamental thingsthat are relevant for human behavior areunknown that's embarrassing becausethese days I can get myself sequenced Ican do proteomic and protein structureprediction I can do large scale conomicsbut I know almost nothing about humanbehavior and so over the years we set upa whole pipeline of work of what we calllivein Labs these are flats that we rentthat we fully digitize and we observehuman behavior to the highest possibleresolution every joint angle ifthe participants consent we have seencameras with eye trackers that's whatyou see in the top right we have thefull sceletal reconstruction we knowwhat they're looking uh and we haveloads of other nice and interestingsensors in that flat that gives ussomething about so to speak the Ecologyof what they're doing okay so you can dothat with healthy people and you can dothat with diseased people okay it's withdata driven there's no deepermechanistic questions we're asking we'rejust pushing the idea how far can I pushthis data aspect so at the moment ifyou're being assessed test for a diseasefor example it's what's a very populartest is the six-minute walk test so Iget you to walk for six minutes and Imeasure how many meter you walk and ifyour disease progresses you walk fewermeters that's used for example forvarious lung diseases for musculardiseases and also for some neurologicaldiseases the problem comes now that forexample for some diseases we know thatif you walk 50 m less than your diseasehas progressed in these 6 minutesbut if I give you a drug or a drugcandidate and you manage to walk thesame amount of distance that last timewe tested you then the drugs works andthe problem is if I give you $20 at theend of the walk and ask you to walk asfast as you can you will also walk 20 Mmore 50 those 50 m more so there's a lotof uh uncertainty and a lot ofAssessments especially in thepsychiatric but also neurological domainare often subjective by ey assessments Ilook at you you maybe I have a stopwatchto to measure how long it takes butthey're very crude measures because whywould the distance you can walk in sixminutes be the best descriptor of yourdisease State and so effectively uh wehave for example here the the the redpatience and and the blue healthycontrols and we're mapping that on somescale that some human defined 150 yearsago as being a good disease scale andthen you know it turns out you can'tdistinguish The Blues from the Reds soeasily so then came digital D biomarkersand the idea oh let's capture itdigitally because that's really theImprovement that we can do fine so youremove the measurement noise it's so tospeak more objective there's no morestopwatches here but still the problemis that what you're measuring against ispoor you're assessing against walkingwhile you want to know something aboutyou know dementia forexample so here AI becomes interestingbecause now we can start thinking aboutlooking at the Patients as they are intheir behavioral space but find a betteraxis against which we can project theirdisease state so for example if we lookat this assessment here clearly the redfrom the blues are easilydistinguishable only what is this otherassessment or should there be only oneassessment and so of course because wewant to make useful Technologies we needto think about how to take theseTechnologies all the way back to thehuman defined skilles that's what theFDA the EMA The Regulators require forapproving drugs and we can think aboutthat and I'm just going to show you anexample of what we've been doing so thisis a disorder in children a geneticdisorder that leads to death at aroundage 20 it's called toen and here you'reseeing a child performing with consentof the parents recorded and and andvisible uh a standard assessment thatchildren need to undergo um to knowwhether their disease has progressed ornot this is a disease that has nodisease modifying treatment at themoment and this is the same kid playingin their playroom room playing okay sowhat we were interested in is trying tofind descriptors what we call Behaviorfinger printing that allows us and I usethe technical term to tokenize humanbehavior into what we call a language ofbehavior and analyze its structure andso we have discovered a whole Space ofnatural human behavior out of the uhhealthy phenotype we characterized inour uh Livin labs and that allows usthen to define a single pipeline thatwill work for the child performing theclinical assessment and the child uhjust playing in their playroom in theirdaily life and the critical thing is wecan for example predict diseaseprogression uh with twice the Precisionjust using the behavioraldata uh then with using the FDA goldstandard biomarker and as you going tosee by the end of my first half of thetalk the gold standard is fairlyLaden um the other important thing is wecan can also uh do this exercise uh uhand uh we got data here from large scaleclinical trials about the FDA approvbiomarker in the Precision with which uhuh they were able to predict diseaseprogression so we could basically varythe size of the study populationsynthetically and you see that of coursethe more kids you add the more preciseyou get but this 6-minute walk biomarkerplateus at around 65 kids and that's theminimum trial size expected by the FDAnow the interesting thing with our uh uhbehavioral biomarker we'd call itethomics and analogy to genomics we'relooking at natural behavior of people intheir daily life we can achieve the samePrecision with nine children uh and uhwe can exceed the Precision ofmeasurement with 12 children so thismeans now because we can predict diseaseState 6 months into the future uh thatwe have effectively half the trialduration which means for three stages ofFDA approval you can go from a six-yeartrial to a three-year trial and for anumber of kids you can go from a largecohort to a much smaller cohort andthat's important for drug developmentand so we published this at the start ofthe year in naturemedicine now the other thing that Iwanted to talk to you about is whathappens when you have for example uhgenetic aspects uh and and moreinteresting proteomic aspects so genesis basically what's on your hard disk uhwhen you're operating as a living beingand protein is what's in the ram rightso that's what's currently happening inyou and we of course know that genes butmore interesting proteomics anddisregulation of proteomics uh leads todisease now the interesting thing isthat we can now apply exactly the samepipeline ofprocessing uh and this is a video thatshould be plain but isnot see whether that gets it to workyeah so this is um this is an adult uhcase so these are people suffering fromFrid rice it's a neurodegenerativedisease develops at around 20 leads todeath around uh 45 to 50 and um againwe're monitoring here people in theirdaily life in this case uh the personhas been hanging out in the living roomand we monitoring that identicalpipeline of analysis tic way ofprocessing uh the behavioral data andnow the interesting thing here we can doeverything that I showed you in theprevious case with the Precision ofprediction and so forth but now comessomething interesting because it's a adisorder that deregulates the umexpression of frine which is a gene thatregulates mitochondrial energy levels uhin cells including those of the brain umwe can actually start to ask well if Itake the FDA approved gold standardbiomarkers for these patients that wemeasured at three moments in Time Zeromonths 9 months and 18 months I shouldbe able to predict what your geneexpression level is um based on the FDAproof marker after all it's it's thegold standard for capturing the diseaseand our best efforts and this is withthe GP regressors and a lot ofhyperparameter tuming produces thisresult the measured level of fraxin isnot correlated with anything that we canpredict from the FDA approvedbiomarkers H okay so now we take ourpipeline that I showed you also for thekids pipe that through and Loan beholdwith an R square of 0.82 we canreconstruct gene expression uh and thatwas our second uh nature medicine paperin the year and effectively what thisshows is there's so much information indaily life human behavior if you're notafraid of embracing the richness ofhuman behavior uh that you can startdoing what we now call behavioraltranscriptomics no blood samples neededwe can track variations and geneexpression to a certain extent fromchanges in behavior and we believe wecan apply that also to mentalhealth in in fact I can also show yousome examples why this marker works sofirst of all I'm showing you here um amethod for visualizing the complexity ofhuman behavior on a two-dimensional mapuh and you see here dots the Dots hereare very faint that's why you can't seethem but here they high density regionsof these dots then I can show you what'sthe coverage of uh the clinicalbiomarkers and these clinical biomarkersare advertised as activities of dailyliving because they capture our life andits fully complexity and you see theyjust cover a very narrow region of thestate space and that's a hugeproblem similarly um another problemthat we have is the biomarkers for thekids that I showed you they're sufferingfrom an neurodegenerative disease thatbasically you know systematically killsthe neuromuscular system uh the FDAapproved biomarkers I'm looking showingyou here too the six-minute walk butalso the uh North Star assessment hereon the left you you see the markers goup and then go down again where low ismeans you're really sick and up meansyou're really healthy and that hasnothing to do with the marker that hassimply to do with children as theyapproach the age of seven or eight theyjust become more uh dextrous let's putit that way than children that are fourbut these children are suffering from adisease that makes them progressivelymore discoordinated so another examplewhere the gold standard simply plainlyfails to capture truly what you're doingnow our biomarker in contrast and againthe biomarkers has basically justlearned of the data there was not a lotof in brain juice going into that thatwe used a basan optimization method tofind across all possible ways of markingthe disease the optimal biomarker is amarker that for these very same childrensystematicallyprogresses within the range ofmeasurement that we have had a chance tosee and that will approach zero whenthey're basically um on a ventilatorbecause their breathing muscles alsostopped to work again the samepipeline we can also apply it in acutestroke word so this is an ongoing studythat we're doing where we're measuringuh the state of patience with our motionand behavioral sensors and uh I justshow you here some of the raw data thatyou're seeing and again there's so muchinformation in the state of the patientthat we can predict if they're going tohave a second stroke or develop ununforeseen complications while in thestroke wart with a 1% accuracy and thiswithout knowing the gender their age orwhat disease they have while if we throwall the predictors that we could pullfrom the database of the patient uh wejust achieve 63% prediction accuracythere's a lot of information andbehavior and so the challenge that we'refacing in a lot of domains is such asPsychiatry neurology is that we'reassessing people by eye being subjectivein the raer so we see interpersonal butalso intrapersonal variations would dothat in an artificial setting in theclinic where patients may not feel comcomfortable uh it's context mood weathersituationallydependent and ultimately the problem isthat we're comparing you in yourdiagnosis or your monitoring to theaverage but the go go goal of going todo it by AI not by I is that we can goin an objective manner that we don'thave to be afraid of variability inhuman behavior here because we can usepersonal variations to drive the signalwe can collect this information in dailylife so in your natural habitat or wewould call it politely patient Centricview uh we can exploit and so to speakaverage out variations and context moodweather in other contexts and ultimatelywe can compare you to you because whatI've not told you uh that in these twouh nature met papers we were able topredict every single patients individualdisease trajectory and so that's therichness of information that you havethere so let's take a step back we'regoing to still stick to human behaviorbut let's look at the other side let'slook at the clinician side so we spokeabout before perceptual AI you knowlooking at the patient and getting adiagnosis so diagnosis is just the startonce I know what you have I need totreat you and cure you right uh and soif you think about that that requiresintervention uh so planning managingadjusting what you're doing topeople and so ultimately we're closingthe loop you have um things that you'redoing two things right you prescribe adrug you send them through a therapy youmake them walk in the park and thatchanges the state of the patient and sowhen you make decisions you need to planand strategize what is the best set ofactions uh and here we're using in theterm uh uh in in the context of what wecall reinforcement learning that youheard above before uh the context of howcan we basically learn what to do withthe patients and so the example hereit's a sequential decision-makingproblem we make many decisions one afteranother can be the surgeon who needs todecide how he's cutting through yourbrain to get to the tumor it can bethought of in the context of the shipcaptain that has to get from uh I don'tknow Washington to New York and has tomake many decisions not all of them themare carried out by herself or himselfbut he may instruct humans or machinesto do things for them and of courseultimately the British Butler who readsyour mind and knows what you want andneed before you even say that right sothis is the type of problem that we wantto lookat and there's a very practical need forthat and that's the need uh to deal withThe Unwanted variation in practice so atthe start I showed you the by computerscience stand standard lowclassification performance of humanexpert clinicians in diagnosing diseasehere I'm now showing you the variationin uh in treatments so this is a work wehave done with um 45 clinicians experttrained clinicians where we presentedthem with 30 cases of 30 differentpatients and we asked them you're nowfacing this patient in the W you havetwo drugs to prescribe I'll later saywhat this is but for now just stick tothe story and I can Pro prescribesomething called fluids and somethingfor calledvasopressors and so what these plotsshow you so one row is one patient thatfor example this patient across 45clinicians had 500% in variation in thedosage of thedrug okay 500% 54% and and there wassort of less variation in this otherdrug but there are other patients wherethere was substantial variationsso it feels sort of this is unwantedyeah maybe not all of theseprescriptions are good ideas and maybeyou know we know some doctors who arebetter some colleagues who are betterand some colleagues who are bit morechallenged right so how do we need tothink about that again because we needto do a i and per compare ourselves toeye systems we actually measure thesequantities and so what we're now talkingabout is not digital biomarkers but whatwe calleddigital Therapeutics and specifically uma system that we call the AI clinicianso that's a system that learns fromretrospective data not from interactionuh using off policy policy estimationfor reinforcement learning how toprescribe drugs so as to keep patientsalive in intensive care unit and the BigChallenge here is that patientsintensive care units suffer fromsomething called sepsis that's aninfectious disease and it's the biggestkiller in intensive care unit units it'sthe biggest killer in hospitals and it'sthe most expensive Hospital treatedcondition in the US and in any majoreconomyworldwide in the UK alone 38,000 peopledie from it every year without covidevery patient who died from covid inintensive care unit died with sepsis andthe problem is it's an infection diseaseinfectious disease so you can treat itwith an antibiotics the problem is yourcardiovascular system collapses beforeand that brings us to these Drugsvasopressors That's stuff thatconstricts your blood vessels and propsup your blood pressure and IV fluidsthat just filling up the balloon withmore water to keep your blood pressureworking and it's an interesting settingbecause there's no mathematical model ofthe entire cardiovascular system becauseuh the amount of fluid that you havedepends on infectious reactions and soforth in it's there's no clear model andthat's why human experts are have noclear common solution strategy yeah andthat is also what you have in many othercases where you have white collarexperts making decisions in poorlydescribed State and action spacesincluding uh Psychiatry so what we didis and this is already the secondversion of the system we trained thesystem uh on a publicly availabledatabase and also on our Hospitaldatabase with uh tens of thousands ofpatients there's a lot of AI that I'mgoing to skip over here but basically uhwhat we're doing is this followingprocess and forgive me for gamifyingthis imagine there's a game world andthe patient has developed sepsis and youneed to steer them so that they'redischarged and survive 90 days after uhuh uh being released from Intensive CareUnit and you want to steer them awayfrom the death state so in this caseit's fairly simple to work out what yourpolicy is so in every state of thisgreat world the patient is ining youknow what to do yeah you can do that abecause the the scrip will is very easyB you know how the playing field lookslike and you know that if you go up youend up in our case we have six0physiological variables describing thepatient blood test blood pressure heartrate whatever uh so you need to find astate description and then you need towork out how combinations of drugs thinkpoly Pharmacy will result in a statechange that is desirable or not so wecan now go into the depth of what wehave been developing over yeah now 7years in terms of machine learningmethods the best that we can do is nowsomething that we call Basdistributional policy gradients that's amethod for the affectionados that'sfully basian in the parameters and it'sdistributional so we have also anuncertainty of the rewards and we're nowcurrently working on getting the actiondistribution um um out of of thisbasically we can now visualize that andso what you're seeing here is alandscape of the patient's State uh anda patient may now move through thisstate due to disease or due tointerventions by the doctors and whatyou're seeing here are the red arrowsthat indicate in which direction certaininterventions that were done thepatients was being pushed right in thiscase we have a patient that was uh nottreated and basically uh uh followed atrajectory and then sort of when itbecame really bad they started to steeragainst that and what I didn't say hereis the blue regions are uh regions ofhigh mortality and the red regions areuh regions of low mortality this is avisualization tool we developed tovisualize to provide a cognitive map ofwhat clinicians in this field can onlydescribe through words and it's veryinteresting to look at Handoverprotocols where one clinician is talkingto another prod clinician because it'svery anecdotal but they're actuallydescribing a very complex State space intransition now what's interesting hereis um two things so first of all I canplot here the differenceum between the dosage that the AIrecommended retrospectively to thedosage uh that humans gave and the goodnews this plot here on the vasopressorside is the the more the humansdisagreed with AI the higher was themortality for the patient so this meansour IIs learned something this Exileresult here is actually more interestingbecause there was disagreement and so umand so the AI was so to speak the thismeans that the behavior of the clinicianwas less optimal but if they underdoseby up to liter there was no increase inmortality and so I got a bit concernedmaybe our model had not captured theright thing but uh our wonderfulintensive care collaborators said noAldo a paper just came out they did aclinical randomized control trial ofunderprescribing fluids by oneliter and it had no change in mortalitynow that's interesting because this isinformation these curves that we learnedout of operational data yeahretrospective analysis of operationaldata I'm not arguing against uhrandomized control Trials of course notbut the important thing is it's a waythat we can use AI systems to Prime uhand and uh figure out key candidateelements and of course I'm talking aboutmodeling the perception action Loop ofclinicians right clinician looks at thepatient makes an action so effectivelywe have here a cognitive process acognitive model we're doingcomputational cognitive Neuroscience ofdecision making in clinicians in a verypractical way so we can do things we canlook at the implied out ofb featureimportance for the different parametersthat clinicians were looking at so whydid you prescribe this moment this drugwhat were the most important featuresthat drove you to that and you find herenow the you know these 60 differentvalues that you have in the ICU and forexample you find here partial um O2pressure as as one of the candidates itdoesn't matter what these labels are theimportant thing is that if you look whatthe AI was driven by in its decision youfind first of all that this label umthere's no single value people werepaying attention to the AI system paidattention to more values equally it hasalso a different rank order of whatphysiological variables were importantand it's even more dramatic for thevasopressors where clinicians looked atfour numbers in the AI system looked ataround 12 numbers with high weight againI need to be very clear here these arehighly trained people when they Mak sucha decision and I've watched them doingthat they spend two to 5 minutes pouringover the patient chart sweating andthinking very very hard about this yeahthey're under time pressure and there'sa finite amount of bit rate our ba braincan intake about physiological valuesthere's also such a thing as trainingfor example because there's a specificdefinition uh that is just driven by asingle parameter value because somebodysaid this is the thing you need to payattention to right and all these biaseswe we discover here now we had apandemic sort of there were not enoughICU doctors so now the AI Clin system isin deployment in four London intensivecare units and it's the to my bestknowledge first digital therapeuticsystem in operation where we evalutingit clinically and so this brings us nowto a whole new aspect of how we do thework this is in St Mary's Hospital andthis is um a clinician wearing an eyetracking system head centered so we'reseeing what they are seeing I'm notshowing the eye tracking Dots here thisis a ICU dummy so it's not a real humanit's a robotic dummy that breathes andhas a heart rate and can be programmedto mimic what we want this is so I canshow you I cannot show you a realpatientthere and this is the standard ICU datathey're lookingat and that's the we then asking for thedosage and that's the AI clinician'sinterface where it basically says inthis moment you should prescribe thesetwo drugs and this dosages and these arefour ways I explain my decision to youhumanOkay and then we ask them given thatyou've seen now what the eyes says doyou want to change your decision and doyou actually think it's criticallyunsafe and in this study and then theyleave again uh like they would on theregularWard so this is now where we're lookingat The Human Condition in facing thesedecisions so we've done eye trackingright so and we have QR codes everywhereso we know exactly at what informationthey looked and what information theydid notlook people complain in generative AISabout uhhallucinations well in cognitiveNeuroscience we call it confabulationwhere you retrofit the explanation andwe had cases where condition said nobecause of this and this that I changedmy opinion and we know that you didn'tlook at this and this yeahagain I need to be very respectful to myclinical colleagues because it's a veryhard work but I think these are thetricks that our mind plays with us andso what I'm showing you here is thefeatureimportance uh so to speak or how muchtime clinicians were spending when theywere looking at different aspects uh thepatient maner the vital science monitorthe ICU chart or the a i cream now whatwe did in this case is we programmed theeye condition to perform normally or doreally unsafe stuff not blatantlyobvious unsafe but unsafe yeah where youknow Junior doctor would be scolded ifthey were to do that and turns out inthe behavioral perceptual aspect therewas no significant difference in theclinicians detecting differences betweenthesetwo uh we found that clinicians stoppedunsafe recommendations 78% of the timethat's great 22% of the time they didnotstop uh we had interestingly the alsothe case where they can stop and ask forhelp for a more senior clinician to comeinto place that happened around 85% ofthe time in the interesting thing is uhthey stopped safe recommendations asbeingunsafe where again these were designedby ICU clinicians uh the interventionsthat the system recommended to to to tobe one or the otherand this is just to show you uh what Ijust mentioned earlieroops that the actual and the reportedattention that they uh placed on thingsdid not correlate with eachother so where does it leaveus I've showed you examples of AI basedrecommendations and what we ultimatelywant to think about is and I gave youjust two examples of that how we can canthink about more holistically managinguh health and well-being across thehealth span yeah not giving you maximumlife but giving you a very healthy lifefor your lifeexpectancy and I've given you twospecific examples I've shown you how wecan get very high resolution Statedescriptions of the patient uh usingbehavioral biomarkers deren derived fromnatural behavior something that we calldoing ethomics and I showed you anexample how a very different domain uhwe can intervene on patients uh in sucha way that um uh that we can optimizetheir outcomes and the I cliniciansystem is predicted to reduce mortalityby 8% in the UK or 4,000 lives if itwere rolled out in all 221icus so this brings us so to speak tothe closing of the talk what I wanted tohighlight and I'm not have time to showyou is that I've shown you is basicallyslices of data we can collect it'sobviousthat if you bring more data together itwill help you more if we're talkingabout mental health your social mediaactivity your emotional activityenvironmentalfactors gut activity will be linked insome way it's obvious yeah we we liveembedded embodied in the real world sogetting these information together isimportant and this also can us now bringto think about how we want to deliverHealth and Care our current model oureconomic model for health is mainlydriven by the Health Care Systemgenerates Revenue by treating yourdisease can we think with the sametechnologies that I've exemplified youabout making prevention the primarydriver to deliverHealth there's of course a difference ifyou're in a private healthcare systemit's not as good if your public fundedHealthcare System the citizens cansimply vote that we want to maximizeor minimize the the risk of of ofdisease occurrence in the first placewhat I've shown you is that we want todo things not in the lab or in theclinic we want to do it in the wild webelieve that the way forward is not tobe open loop but Clos Loop in treatmentand we want to avoid human inductionbias and be datadriven andultimately uh this is Picasso'sbeautiful def descrip depiction of thelady on the beach in all its richandliveliness and you know we seem to bedoing this at the moment we're breakingdown the human constitu its elements andit's I'm sure very organized andstructured by the Swiss artists allverly but uh I believe that if we applyAI right we can overcome some of ourhuman limitations or unease with complexthings and go back from the postgenomichuman to look at the full human and withthat I think all my funders and anamazing research group thank you verymuch well we've covered quite a largearea here and I can see already thereare people who have questionsplease thank you so much this wasfabulous uh I digital Health policy forthe American Psychiatric association andI have 500 questions and I'm going toask you my most boring one and Iapologize uh so this may have been lateron in your talk but in the Americanregulatory environment right now we'rereally struggling with the definition ofa digital therapeutic and and the onethat seems to be rising to the top is asoftware-based kind of non-clinicianmediated uh product that can replicatethe the the efficacy of a pharmaceuticaland so I have a couple of questions oneis the big question I think is how wetest the effectiveness and those thoseproducts are not being subject to thesame rigor as a pharmaceutical wood inclinical trial and it seems like a lotof the markers that you're identifyingmay be really valuable for a new framefor understanding Effectiveness and sois that a direction that your researchis taking both the products and the newways of thinking about establishingEffectiveness sorry great question solet's start with The Regulators so ourCent has been working since 2019 19 withthe entire regulatory pipeline of the UKso MH National Institute of clinicalExcellence Care Quality commission andso forth and we've been doing jointtraining exercises because uh the UK ishighly motivated and having proactiveand not reactive regulators and so wehad already a number of AI sandboxes inthe UK where we could basically try anddeploy things um so I think that'stalking to each other is an importantaspect in this I think if we're talkingabout specific deployment and regulationwhat I've shown you upair up here is inboth cases uh AI is a medical device amedical software device so that's withinthe regulatory framework what we shouldbe talking about in in the domain ofmental health is that of course thewellbeing aspect which it's not MediCalor clinical in that sense but I thinkit's also an important aspect and herewe need to talk about the safety ofpatients that they're not treated by youknow somebody who just coded up and upis now following by it but at the sametimeum keeping everything under a tightregulatory landscape makes it very hardso we spent we did the first work thedle biomarker work uh effectively fiveyears ago it came out now because wewere trying to find out a regulatorycompliant way to patent thetechnology so that actually somebodywould actually use it because anunpatented biomarker is not furtherdeveloped because there's no worthprotection in the development for it andso there are some Hur here so we need tothink about how we can carefully movefrom the clinical to The non-clinicalDomain and back or from the regulated tothe unregulated one thank you so muchappreciateit hi um this is is from University ofSouthern California information SciencesInstitute I like so many things aboutyour talk like her I'm going to try toonly ask her one question so one Iparticularly like is about the Wild andversus the lab actually this yearthere's a paper coming out that they arearguing that these are two verydifferent problem domings and they triedto use a lot of prediction models fromthe lab applied to like in the Wilderdata performs very badly right becausewe perform very differently so I'm supersuper interested in the daily livesbecause when we talk about mental healthessentially we really need to understandthe dayto day so you talked about thebehavioral s source of data in the dailylives like natural behavior there's alsolike you know brain part of the uh youknow data like there's possible EG capsand stuff but essentially they're stillkind of intrusive like I cannot wear awhole suit or a cap to go out shoppingyou know what I mean if we want to havereally holistic View and understandpeople's dayto day in your opinion if wetry to minimize uh minimize the you knowintrusive uh aspect Act of things tomake people not pay attention to thosemore and more naturally what would yousay are the most informative sensors ordata sources we can draw from to predictlike mental state and to understandmaybe nearly as well compared to usingall sorts of fancy stuff that's moreintrusive okay so if you want to beprincipal about it you should go fromMaximum resolution and then work out howto reduce it from 17 sensors where youjust put one sensor where you should putthat I think that's one aspect I thinkthen it also is very applicationdependent so in the case of thesepatients they're dying from a treatmentdisease for which there's no treatmentbecause it's too high risk for Pharmacompanies to develop a drug okay so theyhave a very high rate of compliance andretention in the trial literally I thinkonly no one dropped out during the trialuhbecause it was so important to them andthey didn't mind to wear the suit rightif you're now talking about monitoringyour health before you're getting sickin a daily life basis yes uh then we canthink about especially if you thinkabout domestic data sources you candeploy radar system you can deploy sortof not overly intrusive systems and wehave them in our Flats to to monitorpeople but ultimately you want to havesome ground truth otherwise you knowit's just oh I've developed a new sensorlet's just throw it at it but we want tohave a principle reason why this sensorin which settings will operate or notyeah yeah thank you so much veryinformative hi uh jri research engineeruh this was a this was a really amazingtalk I was thinking about a lot ofdifferent applications but uh I guessI'm thinking also about like regulationsand then how do you clearly build biggerdata sets by starting as early aspossible I mean I think a lot of timeswhen we open up apps and you knowwhether we want to or not we accept theterms and conditions and just to be ableto use that app but I was thinking likewhat if you're you know you're pregnantyou're about to give birth and then youaccept terms and conditions to be youknow biom markered on the very beginningand I I mentioned that because it seemslike from you know beginning all the wayto you know old age there would be agreat set of data to really figure outespecially with particular uhcommunities uh mental health issues oryou knoweven educational things I I think itagain uh it depends on the model ofhealthcare uh we're in a public in theUK a public healthc care system uh sothis means two things uh everyone goesthrough the same infrastructure andthrough the same data uh so uh in Londonwe have two and a half million patientsin our secure data environment and wejust want to Grant to put all of theLondon data environments together with10 million and we foresee that withinthe next 5 years we're going to have all65 million people in one databaseeverything every heartbeat when you hadan echocardiogram every brain scaneverything someone ever wrote okaythat's that and we believe that if wefind Solutions in this technology we canactually even potentially partially payfor the cost of the Health Care systemwith intellectual property we gain fromusing that data and that's because it'sowned by the people and it's for thepeople it's a different model uh inother countries with other systems needto operate differently with that butyeah from the grave from the Cradle tothe Grave is something that is going tohappen and it's already happening ohexcellent um I some great talk uh thisis mother sudin I'm transitioning intoAI so uh through your live living lab uhwere you able to distinguish betweennormal behavior versus disease behaviorand use that information to identifytriggers for anxiety depression um Rtraumatization Etc so great question wedid not uh we call it behaviorallysequence patients with mental healthdisorders in that way we've done uhseveral trials with several hundredpatients using just mobilephones uh uh and and the data we can getfrom there and this would have with moretime what I would have spoken about uhbut yeah we believe that you can getsignatures of that and we believe youcan also potentially get uh you know uhinformation about switching and bipolardisorder and so forth from changes inthis Behavior okay and uh also to use uhsuch information to identify uhbehaviors that support cognitivestimulation yes so we're working withDimension and Parkinson's patients atthe moment to think about what is theoptimal trigger and for that you justneed to in dementia for example knowwhen are you more Lucid during the dayand when less and there's a hypothesishere that if I can stimulate you duringthe Lucid moments it carries over to thenon-lucid moments all right thankyou okay thank you Dr fro uh twoquestions and online so the first one uhuh so they're asking so have youidentify a certain circumstances or waysin which more data could lead topotentialharms okay um I'll keep it simple Ithink data saves lives uh if you use itin the right way uh protected by dataprotection standards that put thecitizen in their data in the in theForefront if you're Mindful and verycareful about biases I showed you UKbiobank it's a great data set but it'sthere's a lot of white Highly Educatedwomen in this data set who basicallyvolunteered for that trial um and andand there biases in that data and so weneed to be aware of these biases and tryto avoid them um so that's why more dataneeds to be also the right amount ofdata that you'reincreasing okay so another questionabout uh so someone is a so asking sohe's he or she was in the field ofaddiction and it's a different type ofthe pandemic so yeah so asking for anyof the suggestions if you know anyone soor specific and la and working in thisarea so we are not working on addictionum and the question is what type ofTechnology you want to give a personwith a with with addiction to help themuh is it when the system detects thatthey're so to speak in emotionally frailState and now having a support callwould make a big difference to prevent arelapse these are potentials we canexplore but again we need to be verycareful none of this has been studiedthese are just ideas I'm throwing herein the air but I think we can helppeople because ultimately what the AIsystem gives you is so to speak like youknow a benevolent angel on your shoulderthat looks over you and can nudge you todo the right thing in the rightmoment thankyoumy hi that's uh I'm M mea from UCLAgreat talk so we learn human beingslearn quite often from mistakes and wecan't really look inside our brains tosee how did we detect the mistake whatwent wrong for us to realize that was amistake especially in such complexconditions but in case of AI you canlook inside so I imagine there weresituations in which your AI agentactually made an error because nothingis perfectis it possible to look inside and findout why that error occurred whichrelates to the nice question somebodyasked that too much data can be a badthing we know that AI models can be verybrittle and as we increase the number ofparameters the brittlenessincreases so can one do something ofthat sort where one can look inside theeymodel and figure out where the errorscame from was it from some SP fous dataSo-Cal nonsense variables as we call ingeneralized linearmodels yeah okay so I so it's ultimatelyquestion about explainability orinterpretability um and then using thatfurther so explainability is typically Asystem that tells you what the systemwas thinking as if a third person waslooking at the system and telling you ohhe he said this in this because he'slike that what AI clinician 1.0 was likethat and it was also brittle Aion 2.0 isfar less brittle a because it's basanand deals with variability appropriatelybut also because we have in the pipelinethat generates the actualrecommendations so to speak thisintermediate representation this map Ishowed you and I've not shown you a lotof it it looked like a checker like alike a snow and pepper type thing butactually there's a lot more informationthere that you can clinically interpretin there and it's basically how youslice and visualize that map that allowsclinicians to explore what's happeningso in that way you can uh you can goback in that if you have questions abouttraceability um in in the case of aentrepreneur we've lost the traceabilitybecause that's basically wrapped into uhinto a pipeline of a vae in recar neuralnetwork so there's not a lot oftraceability there but we don't thinkthat in this case that's necessary umalso because it's highly non-trivial forpeople to understand what the rightthing or the wrong thing to do is from aclinical perspective so when we did thesafety evaluation uh we we we pressedour clinical colleagues to come up withrules of what is unsafe and somebodywrote down a rule and then anotherperson said yeah but if the patient hasdiabetes that's actually okay to do inthere was we couldn't find a set ofsimple rules that that you can assessfor safety which is very different fromAerospace and you know if you pull theplane down it will eventually crashthat's there we don't know the sets ofequation and health and even less so formental health so in part of that our tryway to modeling that for adecision-making system is also a way ofdescribing it so you can think aboutthis model as a digital twin of thepatient thankyou so if there are no furtherquestions um I think we can conclude ourmorning sessionand um we want to thank Aldo but alsothe other speakers for a brilliantopening of thissymposium</td>

      <td>The Future of Therapy: Exploring AI&amp;#39;s Role in Mental Health with Dr. Jamie Marich</td>
      <td>yes this is r with concerns and AI Ibelieve in what I know about it I'vetalked to two close advisers about thiswho are also creatives to me it's nevergoing to replace the human touchDr Jamie merage welcome back to the Artand Science of EMDR thanks for joiningus I'm glad to be here today getting alittle edgy with this webinar but thankyou as always for hosting us to talkabout some edgy things yeah I love Edgeand I love your Vibe and I really reallyam interested in hearing how we can useAI for therapy in general and you knowwe're going to talk about mappingsystems today but I want to start Jamietalking a little bit about take a stepback and talk about Ai and you know alot of people talking about Ai and theend of the world AI will take our jobsAi and you know intellectual propertythere's so many things to talk about soI just want to hear a little bit of yourthought about that and admittedly friendI have a lot of these concerns too tothe point where I'm kind of shocked I'msitting here doing thisworkshop and in a year's time I mayregret having done this Workshop becauseas somebody who is an artist as well asa therapist I'm a Performing Artistmusical artist um as I'm going to talkabout here I do a lot of visual art butI'm not somebody who can draw what Iwould consider like actual images withany level of Competency like I can do alot of splashes and Abstract Expressionson a canvas I have dabbled inphotography film making I believe a lotin art as expression but if I was giventhe prompt Jamie draw a picture of howyou see your four-year-old part insideof you right now I don't have that levelof artistic skill to literally do thatright so as an artist I've been havingconversations with some people who arevery close to me about like is itethical to use AI to help us generateart especially because there's someconcern about how a lot of the AIprograms that are outthere use the whole internet which caninclude other artists work to learnpatterns and learn programs I knowtherapists have a lot of concerns aboutAI being enrolled in the therapy processespecially over a lot of these chatplatforms and as somebody whospecializes in dissociative disordersand who has lived experience ourselvesif you try engaging a lot of these AIPlatforms in any conversation aboutdissociation they're still operatingfrom the myths and the misinformationEtc yeah AI has a large language modelslike chat GPT have what theprofessionals call hallucinations andthis is not a therapy term this is acomputer science term so they're justcoming up with random information so youcan ask you know a random question tellme about Dr Jamie marriage and it cantell you that you're you know a I don'tknow a doctor of Neuroscience fromAustralia or something just and and it'ssometimes does that and is that aconcern yeah I I think yes this is rifwith concerns and AI I believe in what Iknow about it I've talked to two closeadvisers about this who are alsocreatives to me it's never going toreplace the human touch and I thinkthat's something we really have toemphasize and even when I show you someof what myself and other systems aredoing here with using AI to map ourinternal world I'm also going to talktalk about ways I've considered and thenhow can I end up still patronizingartists in addition to what what we'redoing with artificial intelligence or AIbut I will say rotem we can have the biglong discussion about the ethics of thisthe conspiracy theories of this but I'malso again going from my two bigartistic advisers who have told me andGarrett you know you know one of them isthat AI ishere whether we like it or not and Ithink a big question question is are wegoingto acknowledge that and assist ourclients to use it in a way that's goingto be the healthiest possible way forthem if our clients are already dabblingwithit and you know this this may be Beyondwhere some of you are at with yourthinking on it but can we learn to workwith it and again my feelings on thishave been very mixeduntil something happened to me earlierthis year which is why I even decided torun this as a workshop and I've run thisas an exploratory workshop for a smallcommunity of plural EMDR therapists thatI work with and this is the first timeI'm even venturing into doing it in alarger EMDR space thank you I appreciatethat I think that AI is here to stayregardless of how we feel about it it'shere to stay and I think we need to bevery careful of which AI tools we useand how we use them so uh I wasapproached by someone on LinkedIn thathas a new platform and basically it doesthe notes for you so one option is todictate your notes so you know do a textof speech the other one and for this oneyou need client permission which I Idon't think I'll ever do but itbasically listens throughout the wholesession and then creates the note foryou so you don't need to write a note itcreates a perfect note for you it's alittle concerning to me yeah and yeah Ithink part of the discernment we have todevelop as therapists as artist islooking at like where does this feelconcerning where does it feel helpfulbecause I'm thinking of a good friend ofmine in the plural Community who isvisually impaired and they have shown mewhat AI has helped them to do with beingable like there's a an app called be myeyes that they use to be able to look atimages online to be able to help them alittle more in the world and you knowthey' have explained to me how AI hasreally emphasized the potential of thatbecause they're able to actually have aconversation with well can you tell me alittle more detail about this pictureand I think it's still important that weas creators do things like alt textand uh considerhow people with disabilities orimpairments may need that extra assistin engaging with media that we take forgranted but even when I do c captionsfor my EMDR training using otter we useAI for that andso yes I have a lot of feelings and Ithink part of the discussion that I wantus to be able to have go forward astherapists is is the discernment aboutwhere is this really it's kind of likeEMDR is it adaptive is it maladaptive isit both depending on the context yeahfirst we're going to see what you haveto present how you do I'm I'm reallycurious cuz I haven't seen it yet wetalked about it but I haven't seen it sodo you want to how do you want to startJamie do you want to talk about justmapping I have I have visuals I I havevisuals I'm going to uh share with yousome of what happened so for those ofyou not familiar with me we have acouple different introductionsprofessionally we're Dr Jamie meragepersonally we use the moner Jamie pluswe also this year have taken to usingthe name the unicorns system uh we are aperson a system with dissociativeidentities that's kind of what we'reknown for in the EMDR space at thispoint uh having this willingness toshare from our lived experience aboutbeing a person with dissociativeidentities in these EMDR spaces wherethere's still a lot of fear andmisinformation about what it means to bea dissociative system so we're adissociative system and a major part ofthat is being this professional who whowas invited into these spaces because ofour professional credentials yet we'rereally speaking to you today stillinformed by some of that but largely asas a person who has received a lot ofEMDR therapy herself uh dating back to2004 when we were first referred forEMDR and we had our first major round ofit there uh between 2004 and 2006 andthen um you know we had some off andontherapeutic engagement over the yearsand then we reent enter EMDR therapy in2016 after having a a prettysignificantly horrible year that led usbackinto uh EMDR therapy with an arttherapist who also knew dissociationvery well and so throughout ourengagement we we saw each other prettyintensively in 2016 2017 and I havestill stayed followed up with the sametherapist largely doing online work uhsince then you know as as we need itbecause I really feel that to be a goodtherapist you have to have a goodtherapist or have some foot in thehealing world to constantly be lookingat your stuff if that's not ProfessionalTherapy hopefully you have some otherpractice that helps you stay tetheredand anchored and working on yourself andI'm fortunate to have been able to stillwork with my therapist and we do a lotof visual artwor as they said she is avisual artist therapist photographerfine artist and so when I've seen herboth in person and online it's verycommon for me to share my visual journalwith her we've painted together we'vedone a lot of the expressive Artstogether and it's really forwarded whatwe've been able to do in EMDR therapyand it has also facilitated us to beable to have a good in between sessioncontainer so if things come up for us inbetween sessions go to our visualJournal sometimes we film make on it ifwe you know have that line processingmay continue after the sessionends our Visual Arts practices ourexpressive Arts practices help us to dothat so I want to give you that just soyou have some context that working withthe expressive Arts is just a naturalpart of who we are as a human and andI've written books on expressive Artstherapy as well uh process notPerfection most notably and something Ishare there and I wrote this in 2019 isI have a very broad definition of whatis meant by expressive Arts because weoften thinkof visual art painting drawing DanceMovement making music listening to musicdrama kind of as the major ones but tome film making cooking Hair Designmakeup design gardening these are allexpressive arts and this work has reallymade me consider even though there'ssome ethical stuff we're trying to sortout with AI is this also an area ofpotential expressive art that can beused with this technological assist so Iwant to start by showing you apictureand gonna give us a few second wellmaybe better part of a minute here tojust take this invisually we might say as EMDR therapistnotice what you noticeand if there are any words phrasescoming up for you you're certainly freeto put that inchat I'll tell you what this picture isin a second but I want to giveyou little time I think I have a guessgo ahead RM uh is that yourfour-year-old part that is myfour-year-old part yes very much uh yeahso we're getting heavy lonely smallbeingwatched so yes this is my four-year-oldpart and I'm going to give you thelittle map of my own system here in amoment rotem has done a lot of work withme and hosted me a lot so he he knows myfour and R uh dissociation dissociationMade Simple yeah so this is my fourthrough much of our adult life we'vereferred to her as four although duringan EMDR session many years ago she saidyou could call us Lucy if you want so wesometimes call her Lucy so this is myfour largely as she exists in ustoday not as she existed when we werechronologically for this image is whatstarted all this with me reallyexploring AI uses for system mappinghere so I was in a EMDR session earlierthis year with my therapist and inEMDR we're a very mixed processorsometimes sessions for us are intenselysematic sometimes we do see things veryvisually and at a certain point duringthe session I won't get into the wholecontent of the session it was as thoughfour was looking directly atus and this metaphor of the luggage thebaggage has been something that's comeup quite a bit in our EMDR session in anew relationship that I'm exploring mypartner and I often use this metaphor ofbaggage uh like oh yeah we both have 50pounds of Samsonite luggage were alwayslugging around with us and I think I hadmentioned that and we went with that ata certain point and four in one of theEMDR past reports you know what are younoticing now four was looking at mesaying please please please don't makeme carry thatagain all of thatbaggage and it represents history itrepresents not that we haven't worked onit but just the things that will alwaysbethere and I was able to say to four as aresponse you do not have to carry all ofthat again I appreciate you being ableto carry what you can right now and itwas from that Exchange in an EMDRsession that I saw very close to thisimage in my head and it was a superprofound session I won't get into thewhole details of how it resolved otherthan my adult being able to have thatinterchange with her was just just superimpactful and in the days after thesession that image would not leave mebut it was positive it wasn't likea torture thing at all it was just verymuch because for is still doing a lot ofher healing especially about ourrelational trauma it's still very much awork in process for her of all of ourparts right and soyou know knowing Garrett my technicaladviser who also has done some work withrotem I've seen some of the amazingimages he's generated with AI over thelast year and so I almost kind of feltlike I was cheating on my artistic Sideby saying let me bring out one of theseAI apps because even though I can drawthis symbolically I wanted somethingthat looked morereal if that made sense and so I createdthis using an app called Da Vinci d a vNCI and depending on where the flow goesI can I don't have much recommendationshere about the technical apps that youcan be using for this I mean chat chptis the popular one I actually find itvery lacking for some image work Ireally like Da Vinci couple other of myfriends in this world who have donesystem work let me see the magic studiois another one that has come there'sanother one Jamie especially for visualsis it's called mid Journey used it Ihave zero Talent when it comes to youknow anything drawing but I'm I'm reallyinterested in psychedelics and you knowI have a webinar next week and I have acourse and it really helped me todevelop psychedelic art and I have tosay it really it feels good for a personwho has no visual skills or visual artskills to generate something to put intext and then get this and then you caniterate and change it if you want ittook us if you know anything aboutprompting AI apps for images they'llbring back a lot ofgarbage or a lot of stuff that obviouslyisn't what you had in mind so it took meprobably about 20 tries of describingwhat I wanted because that's how AIimage works and that could even be anart in using your words to describe theimage and so when I saw this one as anoption because I believe I prompted thiswith something likefour-year-old blonde girl lookinglostluggage one big one small so I hid in alot of the key words and when thisreturned it was like boom like this isit but it took me a lot of trial anderror even with the words and seeingimages that were returned and when I sawthis I was just absolutely overcome andI shared it with it like oh my goshmaybe I'm finally on board with AI artbecause this is not something I couldhave actually drawnmyself so if you've taken presentationswith me before you may have seen thisslide uh because I used this in thedissociation Made Simple training I usedthis for the webinar on parts that I ranhere for EMDR Learning Community a whileago my majorparts in my car with me because I usethe car metaphor to describe my systemis we have Jamie the adult who's thedriver and my major parts are 49 and19 and those parts largely formed atthose ages to hold and help me gothrough what I was going through atthoseages and so in the past when I'vepresented this I've used thisslide now yes this is what Ichronologically looked like like at 49and1819 and I look at these picturestoday and what they largely representourhistory we could look at them we couldanalyze them you could probably tellthat I grew up in the 80s by seeing afew of the images right but these don'treally reflect how the parts exist in usnow becausewe are someone where all of these partshave been along with us for our EMDR andour healingjourney and so when I saw that image offour it made me start towonder could I useAI to help me map my wholesystem for how I experience these partsnow so I feel that this slideis a lot more representational than thisslidenowadays on how I describe my team andmy system so let's break this one down alittle bit more because we've alreadyexplained four and how this image cameto be and I am going to show you somealternate images of four that Igenerated too in different moods thatshe might be in all right so this mainimage on topis Jamie if you've heard me speak beforeI've talked about this kind of shapshape shift that happens between DrJamie marage and just Jamie who'swearing the hoodie and really thinks alot of this field is just so full ofitself that why are we here doingthis uh but you know Dr Jamie here I amwith my microphone that I'm using I'mdressed up I'm I'm in my moreprofessional mode that's kind of theSuperwoman part if you will and thenthere's just Jamie and as an osddsystem this adult 45-year-old body isthe one who is driving the car at alltimes but even she can shape shiftbetween are we showing up more as Jamieare we showing up more as this likesuperwoman Dr Jamie and the three otherparts for9 and 19 are largely passengersin the car with us and the metaphor thatwe like to use they will make it veryhard for us to drive if they're indistress and of course at other times inour life particularly in 2016 when were-entered treatment we've been in veryhighdistress all of these parts have beenalong for the ride with us doing EMDRtherapy all of these parts have donetheir own share of EMDR targetsthemselves so why wouldn't they changeand we're very much of the belief thatyou don't have to integrate in order tobe well that functional multiplicity isa real thing that what we can worktowards is more of a collaboration acommunication between the parts so we dowe represent that perspective that myparts never have to goaway but they're always going to be onboard with us and as a result they canbe dynamic and healing as well so I talka little bit more about nine so this isnine again this was us at chronologicalnine with kind of the feather haircut SLmullet that a lot of us had in the late' 80sand it was just a pretty miserable timefor us in our life and this is how wevery much feel ninenow because nine a little backstory hereis the part that we've traditionallyAssociated and even now as we're talkingshe's kind of like watch it watch howyou talk about us nine is the part who'straditionally been associated with ourself-destructive Tendencies because wehad our first Suicidal Thoughts andflirtations at 99: we startedself-injuring at 9 UM and the reason wechose this like rainbow plaid shirt forher is that in a lot of EMDR sessionswe've had we have seen her in thisreally horrible plaid shirt that ourmother used to make us wear and itrepresented kind of like we have nochoice we have no bodilyautonomy this is just a prison evenwearing this piece of clothing and andso even in our EMDR sessions over theyears when we see nine she's kind ofevolved to wearing a plaid shirt butit's one of ourdesign it's rainbow it's Pride it'sawesome and the arms are a Kimbo andshe's wearing the sunglasses because inher healing she still has that snarkyquality she still has that ability totell us things like Jamie would you stopjust being so positive and meditatingall the time and just let yourself besad it'sokay so she doesn't have this tendencyfor Destruction anymore a lot of thathas healed but she still is very muchlike our internalbadass that can still keep a cynicalview of theworldbut that's what helps us do a lot ofthis kind of speaking out that we'reknown for she's awesome they're allawesome but we look at this and thisvery much more feels how nine has evolvefor us today and then I love the I haveto say Jamie I love the posture I thinkthe posture staying a lot right likestanding like this with the sunglassesyou you lost the 80s kind of haircut andyou're like don't don't mess with meyeah yeah and somebody even looked at itonce and said looks like a little Janicedropin and I said I'll take that as acompliment I I will really take that asa compliment so 19 up here I especiallyuse the AI to prompt somebody withbleach blonde hair because when we werekind of between the ages of 19 and 22 wewere constantly dying our hair to try tofind that right color for us so we oftenhad our hair very bright when we werethat age chronologically but that's howwe still feel her inside like she's theone who represents our desires ourdesires to see the world our desires tobe sensual our desires to break out ofthis religious mold in which we wereraised and so yeah if you look at thishere she's in a village with flag she'sthe one who really helped us to firstsee the world and if you know anythingabout my story for a lot of years we didnot listen to 19's wisdom because weAssociated her with our alcoholism withour addiction because yeah we also kindof crossed that line into alcoholicbehavior when we were 19 but healing andEMDR has helped us to seeof course we did because we were goingthrough this huge adjustment of seeingthat there was a bigger world outthere and then the Unicorn here weactually used AI to generate this uhsince weuse the car right to uh metaphor oursystem this unicorn is like the hoodornament of thecar and just so you know not all systemshave a name not all dissociative systemsuse a name I certainly tend to only useit with people who are in the no I I useJamie or Dr Jamie in the rest of my lifebut this year I was teaching a courseand talking about this idea that not alldissociative systems name themselves buta lot of them do and even as I wastalking about that in the course all ofthem kind of said in consensus why don'tyou call us the Unicorn system and theUnicorn is this archetype that we havelong connected to since we were a kid asa mythical creature um if you knowanything about queer sexuality we verymuch identify as aunicorn uh a lot of people have seen uskind of like as a unicorn professionallybecause we say a lot of things peoplewon't say and this is us this this isvery much us when you look at thisscreen so rotem you know me you know uspretty wellI'm just wondering if I can get anyother Reflections from you about lookingat the screen and I see a few otherfriends or people I know are in theworkshop as well so if you want to typeyour Reflections in the chat I'd love tosee it yeah I love what you said thatthese are not your parts as they're notrepresenting accurate history so yourpart as they were at that time but whatthey represent now after doing a lot ofwork with them and I can see how thatcan be work in progress right like thatcan be something that you as your partsdevelop and you know get to know eachother and become more adaptive inwhatever way you want to call it butgetting you know healing then you areyou know you can update it with yourwork yep and I want to be clear I'm notthe first system to do this because evenwhen I started sharingthis in the group I run for plural EMDRtherapists uh some folks are like oh Iheard other systems have been doing thisso I know it's been done but like a lotof things I I'm probably the first uhwith kind of my stature who's gettingthis out there as like yeah this issomething we can do this is anothercreative step we can take uh withhelping people system map so on thattoken I just want to share with you afew other images and I really do want toopen this up to discussion so if you'veever tried using AI apps to generate artbefore as I said they're going to bringback several different types of imagesand several different timeses ofdescriptions some AI apps will work withan actual photograph so you may upload apicture of yourself now and you can typein the prompt generate this person as a9-year-old child riding a dragon on chatGPT now you have to specify I own thisimage and give rights for it to be usedsome of the other apps you may not needto do that again I'm not so up on whatall the different apps can allow you todo I think this was Da Vinci as wellI've had the most luck with da Vinciwith my style and my kind ofproclivities and this was just anotherimage that I believe I typed in using mygeneral description of nine as I see hernow if you notice the curly free hairand the sunglasses is a big Motif herethe rainbow checkered shirt and I askedher to be riding a rainbow color Dragonbecause mythically we also connect withthe archetype of theDragon this is another rendering of19 19 was the one who wanted to go tofilm school who wanted to explore morethings artistically but we you knowweren't allowed to that was a big partof our story so this is anotherrendering of 19 in a different stylebecause the nice thing about Da Vinci Ilike is they have different categoriesof styles so you can do like Pixar styleanimation style this kind of looks likethe style that the TV cartoon Archer isdone in you could do sacred art style soyoucan imagine yourprompts enter them in and getRenaissance art style returned back andit's not to say the other apps can't dothat but what I like about Da Vinci isthey give you the ideas of thecategories whereas in chat GPT might orothers you might have to type in in thestyle of Renaissance art so hereis another rendering offour and this was based on an actualphotograph of us we have a little lambstuffy that we've taken to conferenceswith us people with systems tend to likeour stuffies it's it's just a thingespecially as comfort to these youngerparts and so these are two other imagesof four that we typed in with the actualimage Da Vinci allows you to do thatsome of the other programs allow you todo that I think these might have beenchat GPT though um or no the one on theright was Da Vinci the one on the leftwas chatGPT and yeah the one on the right thisis very much what we looked like at fourfor sure uh kind of before that horriblepicture I showed you when we were inthat kind of church prison that pictureof me at actual for was from a churchfestival and they had this game whereyou could put your children in animaginal prison and have the prison Wardand babysit them and if you wanted toget out of the church prison thenparents could donate money to the churchso lot of symbology there a lot ofmetaphor there I'm going to be doing aBlog on that but yes kind of before ourlife really got shitty at four this isvery much how we sawourselves and this image on the rightwhich is ver or the left which is muchmore cartoonstyle and what I love about what theypicked up on here is the actual picturethat we gave chat GPT to use our hairwas highlighted magenta purple at thattime and they picked up on that littlehighlight thread so with this image onthe left I want to give you an idea hereof where you might be able to use AI asa start and then compensate or payactual artists going forward I wouldlike to create some kind of animationwith this rendering of four connected tomy Memoir that's releasing now could GPTor could AI create animations probably Iknow there's a lot of programs that aredoing that now but um I would like youknow in my ethics and to work with anactual human being on creating thisanimation but using this as a startingplace because I think this is a very funrendering of four as we see her as wefeel her as we experience her this isanother four we playedwith rainbows unicornsthis one's fun tome this is a picture an actualpicture of us with one of our partnersthat we putin and I have this four-year-old partthey have a six-year-old part and Ibelieve in the chat prompt I putsomething like can you render us both asfive-year-oldsand this is a picture that I look atsometimes when I just need to bereminded that we're still kind ofnavigating our relationship knowing thatwe both have youngerparts that are still healing So Jamie asI as I'm watching this I have a millionthoughts and a million questions so justto clarify so this partner of yours youdid not know this partner when you werea kid right so correct so so what the AIcan do is take pictures of both of youas kids and put it together no it wasn'teven both of us as kids the picture Igave AI was us asadults oh so so AI created the versionof you as kidsyep that is so interesting yeah becausethis even this pose we're doing in thepicture is a pose that I got of us in apicture in in an actual picture that wetooktogether yeah yeah another thought thatI have is like as you do your work withyour parts and they develop you can youcan make slight changes so you can takethe same image and make slight changesyou know just giving the AI programyou're using prompts and then make veryslight changes and then that willreflect the progress that you do intherapy that is a potential use as wellyeah I'm going to show you I need totake it from my phone to the screen herethough because I talked to you aboutnine as being like the little you knowthe little Rebel the little Spitfire andhow even when that that same partner sawthat rendering of nine he said oh mygosh it looks like a little JaniceJoplin and I think one day it was afterI had done aworkshop and I said to the the kind ofplural group that I hang out withum you know n nine was really unpluggedtoday nine was like really in herelement today uh was just superunplugged and so somebody said use AI togenerate a picture of Jamie unpluggedwhich I thought was kind of fun and souh yeah that's what I'm about to showyou next how I took that same image ofnine and I put it in the chat GPT or Idon't know if I use chat GPT I again Iprobably use Da Vinci because Da Vinciis where I've had the greatest successso I put this picture ofnine I'm opening it right now and I'llshow you I said can you draw nine as aartist playing aguitar when I didn't tell chat gp9 Ijust sent them the image and this iswhat it turned up for me forus now she's playing left-handed we'retechnically a right-handed guitar playerand I thoughtof asking the AI program I used tochange itaround and inside I kind of heard thisno no we like it it's fineso yeah that's nineunplugged and for those of you who knowus like as trauma therapist rans and theperson who's always kind of speaking outabout things we don't like in the fieldthis is a lot of the part of us as sheexists now that generates a lot of thatand you know there are some who wouldsee that as oh my gosh that's soimmature that's so not growing up andit's like we don't want to squash thatout of uswedon't nor do we believe we have to Ihave done this now with a couple peopleI work with I've done it in uh with someother professionals who I Mentor uh Idid mention that I run a group onFacebook for uh plural EMDR therapistsand if you are an EMDR therapist whoidentifies as plural in any way yourselfand you might want to take part in thatgroup I'm putting my direct email in thechat we do screen the group prettyheavily just for safety andconfidentiality so emailing me andexpressing your interest would be afirst step and yeah a lot of of friendswho are in that group it's up to them ifany of them are here and want toself-disclose we've been playing with AIin the last couple months now with heythis is how I would map my system someof us have shared them more publiclyother people have chosen to keep itprivately um I will say with a lot ofpeople I Mentor when I showthem myrenderings there's this oh my gosh Inever thought about using AI at a partsmap so let me go ahead and do that andwhat is meant by a parts map I've saidthis before when I'vespoken that I don't really subscribe tousing any one model in treating orworking with dissociativedisorders the previous webinar I didtalked about that but I do think itcould make it easier for your clienttheir system for you as thetherapist uh to work if you do have someidea of a map or a list of how thedifferent parts interact with each otherhow they may be formed in the system andyou don't have to have a dissocia ofdisorder to do parts of work with peopleI think we all know this and indissociation Made Simple in thedissociation Made Simple flip chartwhich is now officially out as of July9th it's still on the pre-order and ifyou hang around to the end you will geta coupon for this if you like I do givesome ideas for just using symbols youcan use circles and squares andtriangles for parts mapping for peoplewho may be more artistically inclinedthey may draw out a map but even collageimagery can work great for parts mappingthere's a lot of things that are on thetable for it all right right so J DrJamie mer thank you so much for yourtime</td>

      <td>welcome to the huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science andscience-based tools for everydaylife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm aprofessor of neurobiology andOpthalmology at Stanford School ofMedicine my guest today is Dr Jonathanheight Dr Jonathan height is a socialpsychologist and professor at New YorkUniversity he is also the author ofseveral important bestselling booksincluding the codling of the Americanmind and more recently the anxiousgeneration how the Great reor IR iringof childhood is causing an epidemic ofmental illness and today we talk mainlyabout the anxious generation however itis not a purely pessimistic conversationindeed Dr height offers several ClearSolutions to the Mental Health crisisthat now exists and that we have allcreated through the use of smartphonesin particular in kids entering andtransitioning through puberty duringtoday's episode we discussed so-calledcritical or sensitive periods for SocialDevelopment for the development of anunderstanding about competition andviolence about sex and how boys andgirls are impacted differently bysmartphone use and the specificsolutions that do exist and that Drheight has created that can place boysand girls as well as young adults backon the trajectory of mental health sotoday's discussion is really one thatbrings together an understanding ofneurobiology psychology socialpsychology and technology in ways thatare designed to serve the most criticalmembers of our species meaning Our Youthand for those that have already gonethrough youth today's discussion is alsorelevant to you because as many of youknow and perhaps have experienced mosteverybody nowadays is challenged in someway by smartphones both for the utilityand the ways in which they can diminishour social and family interactionsacademic performance and more so thanksto Dr height today's discussion reallyis a solution-based one and it's onethat is sure to educate inform andInspire specific positive action beforewe begin I'd like to emphasize that thispodcast is separate from my teaching andresearch roles at Stanford it is howeverpart of my desire and effort to bringzero cost to Consumer information aboutscience and science related tools to thegeneral public in keeping with thattheme I'd like to thank the sponsors oftoday's podcast our first sponsor isHelix sleep Helix sleep makes mattressesand pillows that are customized to yourunique sleep needs now I've spoken manytimes before on this other podcast aboutthe fact that sleep is the foundationfor many mental health physical healthand performance now one

onething I've consistently emphasized onthis podcast it's the incredible impactthat light can have in our biology nowin addition to sunlight red light andnear infrared light have been shown tohave positive effects on improvingnumerous aspects of Cellar and organHealth including faster Muscle Recoveryimprov skin health and wound healingeven improvements in acne reducing painand inflammation improving mitochondrialfunction and even improving Visionitself what sets juv lights apart andwhy they're my preferred red lighttherapy devices is that they useclinically proven wavelengths meaning ituses specific wavelengths of red lightand near infrared light in combinationto trigger the optimal selleradaptations personally I use the juhandheld light both at home and when Itravel it's only about the size of asandwich so it's super portable andconvenient to use I also have a ju wholebody panel and I use that about three orfour times per week if you'd like to tryju you can go to juv

discussionwith Dr Jonathan height Dr Jonathanheight welcome thank you Andrew I'm alongtime listener i' I've develop manygood habits because of you thank youthank you you look very healthy and umdelighted to have you here I'm alongtime fan of your work I've read thecuddling of the American mind it's anincredibly important book The anxiousgeneration incredibly important bookI'll just start off with an easyquestion which is how are we doing as aspecies ah how are we doing as a specieswell as a species as one of my friendssaid you know we're going to be prettyhard to kill off we'll be likecockroaches and you know we're prettyinventive in that way uh but as acivilization I think we might well be ata point of there are Peaks and valys andthere are some Cycles in history and weuh may be at one of those turning pointsand uh it's going to be pretty unclearwhat happens over the next five or 10years um it's a very interesting time tobe a social scientist I'll just leave itat that I suppose we can't point to anyone factor but we wouldn't be sittinghere today you wouldn't have written inthe anxious generation and it wouldn'tbe having the incredible impact thatit's having were it not for the factthat smartphones have dramaticallyprofoundly changed the way that weinteract as a species in fact acolleague of mine at Harvard Jefflickman who's world famous forneuroplasticity said a few years backyou know this is probably the first timein human history that humans havewritten with their thumbs implying thatthe brain representation of the thumbsis probably very different in all of usum than it was uh prior to that becausethe brain is an Adaptive map of of ourexperience in many ways that's asomewhat innocuous example of thechanges that have occurred the use ofthe digits uh the thumbs uh to write butthere's so much more going on now as aconsequence of smartphoneso if you were tosay the day the date the year in whicheverything changed would it be the daythat most everyone had and has asmartphone um somewhere around 2010 20112012 or did all this start prior rightyeah well actually if it's okay with youI'll answer that by giving sort of thethe history because the short answerwould be 2010 to 2015 but it'll makemore sense if I just sort of go throughhow we got there so changes intechnology when you connect people moreyou get roads you get telephones thesethings are all great um they lead tomassive gains in knowledge productivityyes sometimes they're disruptions but inthe history of humanity they've beengreat um the internet was that when youknow you and I are old enough toremember do you remember the first timeyou saw a web browser I do and it waslike you mean I just like I type in aquestion and I get the answer I don'thave to go to the library it was I meanit was miraculous um and and I can talkto people for free and we had that byemail which was free so in generalConnecting People is good and we wereall very optimistic about the internetin the 1990s it was amazing and in ourconversation today I want to make itvery clear the internet is absolutelyamazing this is not about how theinternet is bad um smartphones or theiPhone you know is absolutely amazingalthough there are some things about itthat are problematic it's reallyespecially social media which haschanged things and so um if we if welook at a kid let's take a teenager in2010 and let's say January 2010 at thatpoint there's no Instagram there's nofront-facing camera um they all havemostly they have flip phones the iPhonecame out in 2007 uh but they don'tmostly have them so in 2010 mostteenagers are using the flip phone as atool to call each other call each othertext each other meet up so whentechnology helps us achieve our goalsthat's good by 2015 everything'sdifferent by 2015 the great majority ofAmericans certainly teens have asmartphone with a front-facing camerathe girls are mostly on Instagram whichwas the first social media platform thatyou had to be on a smartphone foreverything else was web based um theyhave High-Speed Internet unlimitedtexting and now it's possible to spend10 15 hours a day on your phone younobody could do that with a flip phoneso I I point to that it's that five-yearperiod 2010 to 2015 which I've calledthe Great rewiring of childhood becauseit affects everything everything aboutwhat children and teenagers aredoing I can recall in 2010 I wasactually in New York City visitingfriends I got my first smartphone and Irecall I was up at 1:30 in the morning mscrolling on this thing and thinkingthis is unbelievably addicting yeahnowadays I think of it less as addictingbut almost um like an an OCD of sortsand here I'm not talking aboutclinically diagnosed OCD but theinteresting thing about OCD is that thecompulsions the behaviors don't serve toreduce the obsessions rather theyexacerbate them or reinforce them and inmany ways I feel like smartphone use andsocial media use in particular is a OCDof sorts it's not just habit it's notjust anaddiction it's an obsessive compulsiveLoop so it's already a struggle to payattention and you know ancientTraditions have have taught techniquesto improve your focus your attentionwe're easily distracted and um you knowso I don't work on my phone very muchbecause I I hate to type on the phoneand and I'm always at a computer buteven for me sitting at my computer assoon as the thinking gets hard as soonas if I'm writing if I'm doing somethingthat requires concentration some littlepart of my brain says I wonder what theweather's going to be and I go check theweather or you know oh did I get anyemail I go check my I might check myemail you know probably 40 50 times aday and I know that's terrible so thequestion is is it a compulsion where Ifeel pulled I have to check it orsomething bad will happen no it's morelike imagine trying to do your workimagine trying to be a kid inschool and you have on your desk infront of you you have your televisionset your record player a walkie talk totalk to your friends a guitar a paintingset all array in front of you and yourteacher is telling you about you knowgeometry what are you going to doprobably one of these things and so Ithink the smartphone where a flip phoneit's it's a tool you pull it out if youwant to talk to someone then you put itaway but the smartphone there's noreason to ever put it away talk to usabout the scary statistics there's justno way around this yeah and we will talkabout Solutions you offer someincredible Solutions in the bookactually solutions that everyonelistening and watching can participatein not just by restriction and we'lltalk about what that means uh goingforward but where are we at now and whendid we start to see the trend towarddiminish mental health in particular ingirls yeah so feel free to hit us withthe with the scary truth okay sure solet's imagine so in the US we havereally good statistics based on annualor biannual surveys there's three orfour big ones that allow us to seewhat's happened since the 70s and sowhat I'd like listeners to imagine isimagine a bunch of lines maybe a linefor boys maybe a line a line for boysline for girls showing the percentagethat suffer from anxiety depression orthat have self harm those three reallygo together and imagine these lines theymove around a little bit but they'reactually pretty stable from the 1990sall the way through 2010 even 2011there's no sign of a problem on somemeasures they're getting actually alittle bit better because stable and lowstable well low you know if it's ifthey're around say 12 15 % of girlsqualify as having had a major depressionyou know that's much higher than wewould like um that's a problem but it'snothing compared to what it is today sothe lines are pretty flat until around2012 and then all of a sudden the linesfor girls go up like a hockey stick it'snot a subtle thing it really is there'san elbow it's like somebody turned on alight switch in 2012 um now that's forthe American data um internationally yousee very similar things it's notnecessarily 2012 in other countries butthe girls graphs are very sharp the boysare also up on depression anxietythey're also way up depending on themeasure it's usually everything is inthe ballpark of 50 to 150% almost allthe numbers are in that range um we'renot talking 10 or 20% increases here formost things we're talking close to adoubling especially for the youngergirls the boys curves interestingly aresmoother that is the boys are moredepressed and anxious it's but it's not2012 it it actually often begins beginsmore like 2009 2010 and then it justkeeps going up gradually so that that'sa real clue um which we'll come backwhen we talk about the the boy story uma lot of people say oh you know it'sjust self-report um you know just gen Zthey're really they're really umpositive about mental health and they'rewilling to talk about it's a good thingbut the fact that we see the exact samecurves the very sharp uptick for girlsum in Hospital admissions for self harmpsychiatric emergency Department visitsand we see this in the US CanadaAustralia New Zealand uh the UK um theScandinavian countries so somethinghappened across the developed World umaround2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy wasthe first to really raise the alarm sheand I keep saying well you know we can'tfind another candidate nothing else fitsthe pattern oh and there's actually notjust correlational data there'sexperiment experimental data too so wethink you know of course lookeverything's complicated mental healthis complicated if you want to understandwhy one person is depressed there aregoing to be many stories but if you wantto understand why depression rates Rosefor girls faster than boys all over thedeveloped World unless someone can findlike some hormone disrupting chemicalthat was suddenly sprayed over northernEurope and and the South Pacific and theUS and Canada around 2012 there is nothere is no alternativeexplanation so we break down smartphoneuse in these uh young girls thatcorrelates with and maybe is causal forthis diminishment in mentalhealth there are a number of differentvariables right there's the time spenton thephone there's the specific content thatthey're viewing and that's a vastdiscussion that we'll get into there arethe social dynamics associated withbeing on a phone as opposed to in-personinteractions and then there's and Ican't help myself myself but as aneuroscientist who trained in thebiology the visual system there's theeffect of looking at something at about8 in to 12 in away from you for much ofthe day as opposed to navigating anenvironment the way that we had forhundreds of thousands of years prior sothere are a lot of features within thisthing that we call smartphone use rightthere's also the disruption in sleep yepthere's additional blue light exposurethere's just so much to it exactly so ifwe pull all that together for the timebeing and put it in a basket of smartphone use and maybe we'll we'll pull outeach of those variables one by one as wegoforward what are the numbers in 2012 interms of how much time girls maybe youcan give us an age range are spendingwith the smartphone was it they got thesmartphone and immediately we'respending six to eight hours a day on thething or has it been gradual so let'slet's start with the time the timevariable sure okay so first the way youput it is actually very helpful um whatI want listeners to imagine let's saylike imagine on the left side of a slideI haven't made this slide I'mformulating in my head imagine on theleft side of the slide a whole bunch ofharmful changes if you're getting lesssleep that's bad if you're having bluelight at night that's bad if you're notgoing out in nature that's bad if youare sedentary if you so so imagine aboutyou know 15 different things oh ifyou're being contacted by strange menaround the world who want to have sexwith you like that's not good for 11 12year old girls so it's all thesedifferent potential harms and thenimagine all these different potentialeffects S one of which is depression andanother is anxiety another is self harmbut there's doing worse in schoolthere's becoming more shallow there's uhconflicts with your so there's a wholebunch and then we want to look at thecausal connections and what I'm tryingto draw out is suppose you we suppose wecould quantify the degree to which sheertime just spending five hours a day doesthat make you more anxiousautomatically well maybe a little um butthat's probably not the main effect sothere's agigantic multicausal network of effectsnow um I have good numbers for how muchthe how much teenss are using thesedevices and these platforms today um Pewin particular did has done a great jobof of tracking changes in this since theear since the 2000s what we know todayfrom both Pew and Gallup is that youngpeople in America are now spending aboutfive hours a day just on social mediajust social media most Instagram so itthe the huge time suck is the videos soit's actually Tik Tok and YouTube arecounted in this analysis they're countedas social media YouTube is marginallysocial media it's more of an generalinformation Source but the point isespecially the short videos the shortvideos are really really addictivebecause the time between action andreinforcement is so quick that that asyou know in behaviorism like that's thekey it's the quick reinforcement um so 5hours a day uh it's a little bit morethan that for girls a little less forboys just on social media 35 hours aweek of strange stuff coming in fromrandom weirdos on the internet 35imagine letting your kid in Port 35hours um then you add in everything elsevideo games um everything else you do ona smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10hours in that range a day and this isnot counting school now of course inschool six hours a day for a lot of kidstwo or three hours of of that is screentime as well so that's why I say kidsused to have a play based child Hoodplays the basic thing mammals do um andsince 2010 or 2012 our kids have aphone-based childhood and I don't thinkthat is it's just incompatible withhealthy human development maybe we canback up even before 2010 and talk a bitmore about the play-based childhood Iheard you say last night at a terrificlecture that you gave that when we don'ttrust our neighbors we are far lesslikely to let our kids out to playwithout observ ation or oversight um andthat leads to a whole host of negativeconsequences so if we were to dial backto the the history clock even furtherand talk about let's say the 1950s 60sand 7s I was born in75 I basically was kicked out of thehouse every day to go play my mom wouldsay get out of the house I now realizeshe wanted space yeah but we would godown the end the street to the culdesacand we would just play and do all sortsofthings DED some of were were good um andthere were a lot of dynamics that gotworked out in that process my sisterwould go hang out with the basically theolder sisters of those boys that's kindof how our neighborhood happened to bearranged that was fortunate um and theywould do their thing MH so 1950s and 60swhat did social dynamics look like amongkids yeah um so you know I think what weyou need to do is tell this story ofwhat happened as a as a a tragedy inthree acts and the First Act is the lossof of community the loss of trust ineach other so if we go back to the the50s and 60s um but we can even go backmy my parents grew up in New York Cityin the in the 30s and 40s um peoplespontaneously organize themselves intoVillages Village Life is a is seems tobe sort of the default way of livingthat humans have preferred for tens youknow you know several thousand years umand it's where you know your neighborsthe kids run around the all the adultstake part in supervising all the kids uhbut nobody has to helicopter because thekids are playing they're doing theirthing if there's a real thread ifthere's a lion or Invaders then they allcome running home whatever but um butkids need to be out playing with eachother especially Outdoors we evolved insavanas we evolved in different parts ofthe world we're attracted to Nature umso that's the way it it always was nowuh especially if we in the 1950s and 60sAmerica just been through a World Warand the greatest way to make peopletrust each other the greatest way toboost social capital is a foreign attackand of course Pearl Harbor did more forAmerican Co coherence than anything elsein history in modern history 911 didthat too but only for a little while andthen we we lost it um so for a a lot ofreasons people trusted their neighborskids were out playing you know myparents grew up in the depression in NewYork City the kids were all out playingstickball on the street or in a parkinglot in the 1970s there is a real crimewaveum crime goes through the roof actuallyand it goes through the 80s that goesall the way to the early 90s even stillyou were kicked out of the house to goplay um even in New York City all kidswent out to play that's just the way itwas but we begin to lose trust in eachother for a lot of reasons Robert putamwrote about this in Bowling alone thethe the the loss of SocialCapital many reasons for that thechanging media environment airconditioning and television people arenot hanging out on their porch in thesummertime to get away from the Heatthey Clos the door and they put on theAC and they watch TV family sizes areshrinking there not that many kidsaround so for a lot of reasons by thethe '90s is the key decade where act twoof the tragedy happens and that's theloss of the play-based childhood so inAmerica and Britain we freaked out aboutchild abduction and child sexual abuseum some of the scandals were real theBoy Scouts the Catholic Church therewere cases where trusted organizationswere covering up abuse and I recall theabduction thing the carton y thing rightand there was a show I think my name isBrian you know about the kid who wasabducted and then all he remembered Ithink it's a true story was that hisname was Brian he would just remindhimself every night about his real nameyou know I think they found himeventually in Berkeley mhm not callingout Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for along time but um seemed to be thediscovery of of Abu of abducted kidexcuse me in Berkeley uh there are a fewother cases there I don't know whatthat's about um in any ofI grew up thinking that you could getkidnapped right yeah which yeah which isso it's I mean it's the most terrifyingpossibility for any parent um but when Iwas doing the research for the codlingthe American mind I found according toFBI statistics there's only about 100 to150 true kidnappings a year in our wholecountry because if a child like whowould take a child like it's a reallydifficult crime and you're going to youknow who would steal a child from astore you know parents are afraid ifyour kid goes to the next D on thegrocery store they going to be how areyou going to take a kicking andscreaming kid out of a store um it's andyet sorry to interrupt but the showAmerica's Most Wanted I believe washosted by a guy whose kid was abductedand eventually found dead exactly Adamthat's right right so so there was thispropagation of this fear like that oneof the deepest fears of any parent I canto imagine is is is that that's rightbut the point is that these crimes areextraordinarily rare it's almost alwaysthe non-custodial parent who takes a kidit's a family member because there's afight within the family um so we fearthe wrong things we're terrified ofkidnapping um but locking our kids upoverprotecting them has spiked thesuicide rate so much that the death tollis vastly higher from the extra suicidesthan it would be if we could completelywipe out kidnapping which again doesn'tbut you know you know the availabilityheuristic we say in Psychology if it'svisible if it comes to mind easily thenpeople will freak out about that andthat's why people sometimes are afraidto fly in a plane they think a car issafer so so um for a lot of reasons wefreak out in the 9s we stop letting ourkids out we think they must always besupervised so that's act two of thetragedy and as that act ishappening we're keeping our kids insideand guess what these computer thingsthat we started getting in the 80sthey're getting interesting because nowwe hook them up to the internet in the80s what we can do word star and someprimitive video games like but in the90s you get the internet and now thekids especially the boys the earlierinternet was much more of to Boys Boyswould take computers apart they couldbuild computers they would learn toprogram uh so the boys in particularthey're okay with losing out on theoutdoor play because the the internet isso amazing and nerdom started to becomecool revenge of the nerd Steve Jobs andSteve con and I know because I grew upin pal Alto see Steve downtown he hadthis wasn't really like Rockstar personabut he kind of you know weeded back andforth he was he was an icon kind of likea you know counterculture guy but thenhe was into design and compright but it was still really geeky Mlike the fonts were lame he broughtbeautiful fonts to it he startedbringing the aesthetic forward and thenof course girls and women got involvedin computers more yes although thatreally it only really evens out once youget social media um boys are moreinterested in things and mechanics andand systems girls have a more evolvedand and elaborate mental map of socialspace they're more interested in Socialrelationships so once you get socialmedia that attracts the girls more andthen it comes pretty even that all youknow all boys and girls they're justincredibly attracted to the internet andthings on the internet um but that setsus up for ACT three which is the greatrewiring that's the arrival of the phonebased childhood that we just talkedabout between 2010 and 2015 that's wheneverything changes as many of you knowI've been taking ag1 for more than 10years now so I'm delighted that they'responsoring this podcast to be clear Idon't take ag1 because they're a sponsorrather they are a sponsor because I takeag1 in fact I take ag1 once and oftentwice every single day and I've donethat since starting way back in 2012there is so much conflicting informationout there nowadays about what propernutrition is but here's what there seemsto be a general consensus on whetheryou're an omnivore a carnivore avegetarian or a vegan I think it'sgenerally agreed that you should getmost of your food from unprocessed orminimally processed sources which allowsyou to eat enough but not over eat getplenty of vitamins and mineralsprobiotics and micronutrients that weall need for physical and mental healthnow I personally am an omnivore and Istrive to get most of my food fromunprocessed or minimally processedsources but the reason I still take ag1once and often twice every day is thatit ensures I get all of those vitaminsminerals probiotics Etc but it also hasadaptogens to help me cope with stressit's basically a nutritional insurancepolicy meant to augment not replacequality food so by drinking a serving ofag1 in the morning and again in theafternoon or evening I cover all of myfoundational nutritional needs and Ilike so many other people that take ag1report feeling much better in a numberof important ways such as energy levelsdigestion sleep and more so while manysupplements out there are reallydirected towards obtaining one specificoutcome ag1 is foundational nutritiondesigned to support all aspects ofwell-being related to mental health andphysical health if you'd like to try ag1you can go to drink a1.com huberman toclaim a special offer they'll give youfive free travel packs with your orderplus a year supply of vitamin D3 3 K2again that's drink a1.comhuberman Okay so we've got three actsall of which are tragedies loss ofcommunity right so community and trustis down that's right which then makes usnot then act two is we take away theplay-based childh because we're soafraid because we no longer trust ourneighbors and then act three is as longthe kids are are inside and and on oncomputers already oh well now just asmartphone and a tablet these are justcooler computers nothing wrong with thatright and that's what we thought earlyon in the early 2010s we thought thesethings weremiraculous oh you know if my kids usethem maybe they'll be the next SteveJobs maybe they'll you know they'll bereally technically sophisticated wethought and it's not true and now we'rein this third Act of the tragedy youtouched on some of the male femaledifferences um maybe you could uh talkabout those a little bit more so yousaid girls tend to focus more on socialdynamics boys more on systems um I'veheard you say that the Boys in generalVeer toward more for lack of a betterway to put it more on the Spectrum typebehaviors could you elaborate on thatand how it impacts online um use and theparticular sites that they tend togravitate towards and then on the on theother side uh for girls yeah the the theone of the psychological traits that isthe biggest differentiator between boysand girls and between men and women it'sit's let me State clearly the sexdifferences in ability are generallypretty small small and they're few andfar between sex differences in interestare all over the place and they're oftenvery large and they're true acrosscultures and some are true acrossspecies um it's it's what do you enjoyand so um and here I'm drawing on thework of of Simon Baron Cohen who's thecousin of Sasha Baron Cohen um in the UKand Baron Cohen's work on autism showsthat um um you know because of prenataleffects prenatal testosterone changingthe body changing the brain we all startoff as girls in utero after conceptionbut then the 10th week of gestation ifthere's a y chromosome it triggers alittle bit of uh a testosterone whichthen makes the testes develop and thenthat creates testosterone and all ofthis the effect on the brain appears tobe a shift away a little bit away fromempathizing in Baron Cohen's termsthere's you can either be a highempathizer or you can be a highsystemizer systemizers are people wholove Subway men apps and they pick themup quickly and they like programming andthey like to see how systems are relatedit's possible to be high on both butmost people are more one way than theother so once you see that now you canunderstand why this amazing new internetDrew everybody but it drew the boys andthe girls to different parts of it uhand so you know metaphor that i' I'vestarted using these days uh I actuallydid get this from Yasha monk has a agreat book called the identity trap andYasha points out that a trap has to havebait in it that's attractive there hasto be something that makes the creaturewant to go into the Trap and then oncethey get the bait there has to besomething that prevents them fromleaving that's what a trap is and uh inthis case if you want to catch a girldon't show her like the operating systemof a computer don't show her war gamesshow her what Maria just said aboutJulia uh or what Julia just said abouther do you want to know of course youwant to know um and everybody does butgirls more than boys they want tounderstand the social dynamics so thegirls go rushing into Instagram whereeveryone's posting photos of themselvesof other people of the party they wereat the girls go rushing into well socialmedia in general Instagram U Pinterestand um Tumblr were the three big onesthe girls went into in the 20 early2010s and then once they take the baitthey can't escape because now thateveryone is talking on Instagram let'ssay if you leave you're alone no you'renot going to talk to anyone so that'show you trap girls and that's whathappened to girls how do you trap boyswhat are the things that boys most wantto do if you let them do whatever theywant what are the two things that reallyattract them one is War and the other issex so um if you say do you want towatch you know a movie that has violencein it or you know do you want to watchsports which is play War boys are morelikely to say yes or play a first-personshooter game exactly that's right soit's so it's hunting and it's War um andif you can simulate that you know when Iwas a kid there was the beginning I meanI remember playing Seawolf like youshoot missile you shoot you knowTorpedoes at a boat in the distance andit was very primitive technologyBattleship yeah oh that's right evenBattleship that's right that's right abig deal yeah that's right littleplastic boats that's right yeah sinkingsomebody else's Battleship by by iningwhere the location of their ships werebehind a wall it was so satisfying tosing somebody's Battleship so boysreally want to play at War and I reallylearned this when I was 30and my I have a group of buddies fromcollege and we get together once a yearand one year I hosted in Charlottesvilleand we we played paintball we went to apaintball place and there were you knowabout five or seven other other guys andwe divided up into teams and we weredivided among ourselves on the teams andit was unbelievably thrilling to workwith other guys to hunt and shoot myfriends and and we came out afterwardsall of us and it you know it hurts whenyou get with the it hurts which is whichis important it's actually veryimportant because then you really takeit seriously you really don't want toget shot um but it was absolutelythrilling it really felt like like therewas a room in my heart um you know as aman there's a room in my heart for warthat had never been opened so boys wantto play at that and then the multiplayervideo games the firstperson shootergames all these things let them do thatthe other thing of course that boys wantto do is look at naked women and so youknow it used to be Playboy magazine nowit's super hardcore sex with anal sexand gang bangs and and uh you knowchoking and all sorts of things um sothe boys really get that's how trap aboy show them War you know let them playwar games and and give and give them sexand once they do that they can't escapeso interesting we did an episode longago on uh sexual development meaning howhormones influence brain developmentwhich I spent a little bit of time onfor my masters and by the way you gotthe biology exactly right um and it'sfascinating the way that these hormonesorganize the brain and some people enjoylearning that it's testost testosteronefrom the testes it's the Y chromosomethen the testes and then testosteronethat's converted to estrogen that thenactually has the organizing effects ofmizing the brain there all these flipsin biology counterintuitive flips but Ilike to mention the flips because theynormalize the idea that um ittestosterone creates maleness andestrogen creates femaleness that'sactually not true it's but you got thebiology exactly right um but there I wasgoing to add one more thing besides umWar violence and sexthere seems to be aum an interest by Boys in remote controlthings absolutely remote action at adistance action at a distance so remotecontrol cars I never had a remotecontrol helicopter would died to get onebut remote control car that we built mymy dad and I built together that wasthrilling absolutely and then when wetalk about girls um and and some of thethe preferences for certain activitiesum uh maybe we we'll get into someothers but yeah something about remotecontrolum and vehicles generally that's rightso there's there's an importantpsychological word called effectance uhmade up by white in the 1950s effectanceis the desire to be a cause I had thiseffect on the world and you know a a9-month-old infant in the crib when hediscovers if I pull this if I hit this asound happens it's thrilling you didthat and this stays with us for life youwant to see that the things you do havean effect and especially boys are morein the in the physical world you knowmechanical world and so shooting a gun Iremember when I was a kid you know I hada BB gun that I bought at a churchBazaar I I hid it from my mother kept itin the closet but my best friend and Iyou know we set up cans on a row and youshoot them and boom it you know youknock it it's amazing it's thrilling umthat does seem to be a sex differencenow girls I think now here I'mspeculating but girls seem to be moreinterested in having an effect in thesocial World um so everybody wants tohave an effect but boys are more focusedon mechanics girls a bit more on onrelationships in the social world andI'm sure um Freud had a field day withthis but um what is the apparent I don'thave the numbers on this Obsession of ofgirls and horses and caretaking ofanimals and and yet there are also a lotof wonderful stories about boys takingcare of dogs like I read where the redfriend grows maybe 50 times and I lovedogs I love taking care of raising mydog but there's there seems to besomething about um The Stereotype isgirls and horses that's right yeah umwell the simple part is uh girls onaverage are a little bit morecompassionate they feel the pain ofcreatures more boys are more into animalcruelty uh as a fun thing to do aninteresting thing to do effective um sogirls are are more compassionate girlstend more to want to be a veterinarianthan boys do because girls love animalsum my daughter was desperate for a petand we we got her um a leopard geckowhen she was about eight or nine they'rereally cool but she she know she wascrying one day cuz she could tell itit's never going to love me you know andshe desperately wanted you don't knowmaybe it'ss no it's a no it's a reptileno they're not they're not mammals theydon't have the bond and she wasdesperate for a dog and she begged foryears for a puppy we finally got one sheshe needed an animal with a she need ananimal yeah that's that's well sheneeded a mammal she needed anamal um nowthe horse thing that's different I'm notgoing to speculate on that I have heardsome speculation that it's because thethe the musculature it's something aboutyou know it it has a feeling ofmasculinity but I don't know that'sveryan I was wondering whether or not Idon't want to get I don't even got nearthat yeah I was wondering um whether ornot it was something about the um thehealthy requirement for caretaking thebrushing the cleaning the the thecaretaking of the animal is is prettyelaborate when it comes to a horse myfirst had a horse she spent more timewith that horse than with me and um andthe amount of care like if the horse wascing she would literally go sleep withit in the barn you know and it seemedlike she um loved the amount of lovethat was available to give to the animalum yeah anyway I I would put that in ain a giant bucket called biophilia aterm that I love from eio Wilson um justthat our species you know we evolved innature we evolved with relationshipswith animals um and we we cre we seek itout we can fall in love with animals wehave relationships um so I think it's ahealthy part of life and again it'sanother area where a phone-basedchildhood just takes you away from allof that yeah it's interesting thisdifference between um systems andrelationships I was obsessed withAquaria still am I love I love Aquaria Ilove freshwater tanks aquascaping issomething I plan to get back into um atsome point soon but um the mostinteresting part about it was which fishcould go with which MH who would eat whohow many plants what the density of fishneeded to be in order to maintain theecosystem as a and how to not get asystem crash it wasn't so much about therelationship between the fish or or tothe fish that's right so it'd beinteresting to see if there's a sexdifference on on aquariums whether it'smore a boy thing because of theinteresting complex you know systems umbut you know what I what I'd really liketo do with you now as long as we'retalking about sort of you know theseDevelopmental Pathways um I'm hopingthat we can talk about oh oh Let's dolet's stay on sexual development uhbecause this is something I just have alittle section in the book uh in thechapter on boys I have a section wherewhere I review the research onpornography and you know huge amounts ofstudy of pornography over the years umuh but the hardcore pornography highresolution video um boys watching it foryou know many boys well a large numberof boys um um are are you know go everyday to pornography sites often more thanonce a dayum so I'd love to hear your thoughts onhow that would you know how is thatgoing to change sexual developmentduring puberty a boy who starts at sayat age 12 13 and does it for 10years could we expect that that boy willbe different with when he's 22 hisdating life will be different his tellme what you you think is happening therein the brain and socially and hormonallysure absolutely and I'm not going todemonize pornography nor am I going tocelebrate it all I'll say is that myunderstanding of the dopaminereinforcement system and I like to callit a reinforcement system as opposed toa reward system because people generallythink that dopamine and dopamine hitsrelate to pleasure but dopamine is moreof a motivator as a neurom modulator itcreates a kind of an agitation Statewant that puts us in a state of focusand foraging to resolve some gap betweenhow we feel and how we'd like to feel byseeking things like sex like food whenwe're hungry like warmth when we're coldlike cool when we're too warm it's auniversal currency of pursuit okay ofcraving and wanting as opposed to havingokay dopamine does a lot more than thatum and other neuromodulators areinvolved in wanting and craving butdopamine is Central to thatso I think it's not just fair to say butit's a ground truth that whether or notit's a drug like methamphetamine cocainecrack cocaine in particular or someother drug that hits the system fast andcreates a big big inflection in dopaminethat the more rapid the rise in dopaminethe bigger the crash in dopamineafterwards and the more miserable youfeel afterwards and the more repeat ofthe behavior that initiated thepeak will occur AKA addiction okay or atleast extreme habit formation dependinghow one defines those when it comes todopamine the other key thing to know isthat dopamine in particular Highinflections in dopamine big peaks indopamine that occur without much effortin particular the kinds of effort thatevolved to bring about the the thedopamine release such as courting datinglearning your preferences learning theother person's preferences working outissues of discussion consent negotiationEtc when dopamine arrives quicklywithout effort such as with amphetaminecrack cocain or pornography mhm thewhole reinforcement Loop becomes wiredto these short time scales you wantsomething you want it now and you get itbut over time you get less and less ofthe dopamine Peak and you get more ofthe dopamine trough that occurs you dropbelow Baseline afterwards so all of thatis a bunch of neurobiological is nerdspeak for absolutely the readyavailability of pornography at a youknow few Taps on the on the phone um nodoubt triggers big dopamine the firsttime requires more and more investmentin that behavior to get less and less ofthe dopamine you never get back to theinitial value and you're driven furtherand further down the pathway ofaddiction and there's the loss of allthe learning right that the brain andand has evolved to learn how to evokedopamine from I don't want to say justmate Pursuit but it's courtship andeventually sex so and we know that afterafter ejaculation after orgasm there's adramatic decrease in dopamine and a hugeincrease in prolactin what does that doprolactin and dopamine are essentiallyantagonistic to one another it createsstates of quiessence calm it's thoughtto facilitate pair bonding by keepingmates near one another smelling oneanother sharing pheromones in factthere's something called the coolageeffect we could talk about the sort ofclassic coolage effect there these youknow effects that um have to do with theinverse relationship between dopamineand prolactin but with pornographyassuming that boys are masturbating tothe pornography and they are doing thatto the point of ejaculation then they'regetting this kind of quiessence of thesystem um they're feeling lethargicrelaxed maybe depending on their age ortheir motivation they're doing it againand again but neither the dopamine northe prolactin are being devoted toanything about courtship and pursuit noris it in the case of prolactin relatedto anything Rel related to pair bondingthey're just sitting there with theircomputer in their room and of coursethis occurred with pornography as youmentioned before classic pornography butwhen I was growing up if somebody had apenthouse or a Playboy magazine theywould often stash it for whatever reasonbehind a business or something so no onewould get caught with it and then you gothere like a library it was like a thingyou go and it was in places where thisis getting a little weird but wherepeople didn't use the pornography thereI think they remembered it perhaps umbut but they weren't spending a ton oftime with it and they weren't taking infact there was an unspoken rule youdidn't take it with you and this is kindof our most kids first exposure topornography where their dad had aPlayboy magazine or something like thatso I hope I I described the landscape ofthe biology well enough but that theshort answer is absolutely creates majorproblems in the dopamine reinforcementsystem it's training the dopaminereinforcement system for fastreinforcement and diminishedreinforcement over time and none of ittranslates to the real world yes it'snot just the content so I guess whatwe're getting out here here is it's notjust what they're seeing as so extremeand that's an issue clearly it's alsothat the whole process takes you knowminutes yeah that's right and it can berepeated over and over depending on therefractory period of um young as opposedto real world dating and relationshipswhich takes effort and it takes learningthere's hardly any learning in the useof a drug like methamphetamine orcocaine about how your dopamine systemworks unconscious learning there's andthere's hardly any if any learning aboutsex and courtship m in pornography andit's also training the dopamine systemthe whole motivational system around sexto be observational as opposed toparticipatory and I hear a lot becauseI'm in the Wellness Health space and I'ma man guys Reach Out by direct messageHey listen I they'll reach out thatthey're having real issues with erectiledysfunction with anxiety yes and thesethings always existed but there was akind of a a learning a communicationhopefully some you know slow yourbreathing down and communicate and kindof get back to a place where you're morecomfortable they're not able totranslate anything about theirexperience of sex and pleasure to thereal world and as a consequence they'reretreating into a world where they viewif if they're heterosexual the oppositesex or if they're homosexual the samepotential Partners as like these distantforeign objects that they don'tunderstand right wow Andrew thank youthat was a really powerful and cleardescription of what I was trying to sayin the book coming just from thepsycholog logical side which isum to turn from a boy into a man there'sa certain amount of toughening and skillbuilding there's skills that have to bedeveloped and I'm so glad to use theword courtship I use that word a lotwith my students I almost I hear almostnobody else using that word it's such animportant word uh because we did evolvethe ability to parir bond at leasttemporarily and we do have courtship andit has to start slowly if you jump intobed and have sex right away there's nochance of courtship it's that part isover and um so you know as you weretalking I was really trying to I wasthinking and I want the you knowlisteners to imagine imagine one13-year-old boy um who you know reallywants sex would like to have agirlfriend but he has he has a laptop hehas a phone he has PornHub um hemasturbates two or three times a day uhhe'd still like to have a girlfriend buthe's sexually satisfied because he hasall this amazingpornography um and he does this everyday for 10 years until he's 23 let's sayand then we have another boy who youknow maybe he has a Playboy magazine ormaybe he has nothing maybe he just hashis imagination he masturbatesoccasionally as boys do um but hedoesn't have the hardcore porn hedoesn't have the fast dopamine and thenthis second boy he puts more effort toactually having a girlfriend and helearns how to talk to girls and he andhe he's flirting and one is interestedin him um and then they have their firstkiss and you know because I'mremembering back when I was you know ateenager in my 20s the most beautifulgolden days I mean the most memorabledays of my life it was those days whenyou have that first kiss and you knowlike oh this this is going to turn intosomething everything Sparkles after thateverything Sparkles but the point isit's slow and it's hard work and thenwhen you finally do have sex you knowit's not like oh dopamine crash you knowget out of here it's it's as you saidit's like ah you know prolactin rise youknow you hug you hold you hold the girlum and you know at some point you startthinking about marriage like you startthink like is this the one I mean youknow crazy thoughts like that you can'thelp but think that when you're fallingin love and I at myu I teach anundergrad course and I also teach an MBAcourse now the NBAs are all on thedating apps they're in their late 20sthey're all on the dating apps theundergrads some of them are on datingapps but they're you know they're 19they're mostly dating and they in theircircles and for the mbas I really haveto work with them to see that that thedating apps are cutting off courtship ina lot of ways I mean yes you're textingbut it's not the same so um so I'm soglad you explained a lot about that oneis the fast it's the fast satisfactionthat prevents you from learning whereslow hard work towards a biological goallike sex or dating or marriage or loveis what builds you up into a competentman who would want to hire or who wouldwant to date let's put it that way whowould want to date the kid who'd beenmasturbating three times a day to pornsince he was 13 so yeah yeah yeah andand there's all sorts of things I meanmy father's Argentine move moved to thestates in in the late 60s and so I wasraised in a fairly traditional home thefrom the perspective of masculinefeminine roles um there were all thesethings around chivalry like I remembergoing to my first Junior High Schooldance my dad gave me this whole tutorialabout holding the door and how what youknow it's interesting that nowadaysum guys are often judged in terms oftheir latency to respond to textmessagesyou know um something I'm terrible at umand it's interesting that that sort ofreplaced chivalry like how responsivesomebody is so there's a kind of ableeding for it as long as we're we'rejust being very open about the pastpresent and and perhaps future of thisstuff I remember growing up and hearingstories this wasn't how my childhoodwent but I remember my dad telling meyou know in Argentina the young boyswhen they would hit puberty used to betaken to prostitutes so they would learnhow to have sex I that's how I mean thatwasn't that long ago that wasn't mychildhood and I remember thinking likewhat's you know is this is this what'sgoing to happen next and but he wasexplaining that's kind of how it wentthat doesn't tend to happen anymore as Iunderstand I haven't heard of ithappening right but in terms of learningcourtship learning chivalry learning umyou know who pays and a lot of that'schanged with the you know the changingmilu of um sex and gender Dynamics butit's all iterative it's slow anditerative and everything about onlineuse as you mentioned is it's fast youcan find anything with a keyword searchright no work that's right thetechnology makes everything easier andif we if we end up talking about AI atall which every conversation goes to atsome point that's my big fear that AI ismakes everything easy now that's greatfor us adults when we have 50 things wewant to do if I can give 30 of them toAI that would be great but you know howmany servants do I want my you know myson is now 17 when he was 10 11 12 howmany servants would I want him to haveto take care of his needs like probablyzero like zero is probably the bestnumber um but you know with with pornfor the sexual drive with multiplayervideo games for sports or or competitionum that's right our kids are they're notthey're not learn learning or developingand this is why you know I work in abusiness school I talk to a lot ofpeople in in the corporate world and Ialways ask them how how's it going withyour gen Z employees I've never heard agood word I've never heard oh they'regreat um it's they're often people justsurprised at how they don't take initiative if if you know if if something isbroken they don't fix it they want to betold what to do they don't have theconfidence they're very anxious um soyou know I'm not I'm not ragging on genZ I'm saying we blocked theirdevelopment we prevented them fromhaving a thousand 10 that millions ofexperiences of social interaction ofchallenge of failure of fear of thrilland then when they reach their early 20sand they'reemployed employers find there'ssomething lacking so it sounds to melike boys on smartphones or so from this2010 period forward um are getting thiskind of hyper stereotypical maleexperience first person shooter gamespornography girls are getting this umhyper stereotypical female experiencerelational highlyrelational but there are certaindynamics that are missing or certaincomponents that are missing um yesterdayI heard you mention something very veryinteresting to me which is that in bothgroups it seems conflict and any kind offriction is not being resolved among theparticipants but there's the sort oflooking outward for some rule or policylaw or oversight to come in andintervene um could you talk a little bitabout this this relates in aninteresting way to cancel culture yeahthat's right um I would love to to learnmore about this sure so aggression uh isa part of human nature as is cooperationand they kind they kind of have to gotogether you know to make it in thisworld you have to be able to playpolitics you have to have friends andallies you have to stand up for yourselfum you have to push back sometimes butyou have to learn to bury the hatchetand you know if you grow up withsiblings you know you're fighting everyday and you're cooperating every dayit's and it's very important practiceand if you're playing if you're playingsports outside with a bunch of kids inthe neighborhood you're making the rulesevery day and then part of the importpart of what's important when kids areplaying is the infractions it's it'sit's every the play stops people cometogether you know that was out of boundsno it wasn't you pushed me no I didn'tand then every you know everybody getspractice playing judge and jury uhbecause everyone wants the game to go onso they're very motivated to to work itout uh you have to accept the Judgmentwhat are you going to do storm off andgo home to protest then you look like aloser and you don't get to play anymoreso natural play with no adult forces thekids to learn social skills that areessential for democracy how do we makerules together just us how do we decidehow we're going to govern ourselves whatdo we do when it looks like someoneviolated a rule well we're not justgoing to kill them we're not going toexpel them we have to have a way ofgoing on with the play so these are suchcrucial skills for Social Developmentfor boys and for girls and um and kidsalways learn to work that out but whathappens when the boys are growing up onvideo games there are no disputes therecan't be a dispute because the game thethe software basically manageseverything there's no out of bounds oranything um so the play is missing a lotof the the of the key skills now um howare conflicts resolved well on socialmedia instead of like a conflict thattwo girls might have had just the two ofthem or with like a group before whichcould get worked out very very quicklyit's somebody posts something indirectmaybe it's an indirect criticism andsomeone takes it in a way maybe it wasintended that way maybe it wasn't butbefore you know it it's acceleratedpeople are taking sides it it could blowup you don't know how big it could getit could be the whole school now getsdrawn in this is terrifying so a reallyimportant idea about play is what'scalled low stakes mistakes so if youmake a mistake while playing soccer withyourfriends uh no big deal like you knowit's a foul redo whatever it is um butif you make a mistake on social media itcould blow up to the point where you arenow a laughing stock and when a kid whena especially in middle school when a kidis a laughing stock when everyone'slaughing at them that is likely totrigger thoughts even of suicide shamemakes us want to disappear and we'reputting our kids our kids need to beimmersed in small groups small groups ofother kids that are stable somewhatstable over years that's the healthiestenvironment but instead we're mixingthem in with POS potentially giganticgroups including strangers and peoplewho are not engaging their normalempathy skills but are beingperformative judgmental judging in orderto be liked by others so it's just aninhumane it's a it's it's an inhumanWorld in which to raise kids and this ispart of my point about the greatrewiring in 2010 American kids still hada recognizably human childhood with alot of time together with other friendsbut that plunges in the 2010s to thepoint where now childhood is largelyhappening alone on a screen I'd like totake a brief break and acknowledge oneof our sponsors element element is anelectrolyte drink that has everythingyou need that means the electrolyt sosodium magnesium and potassium in thecorrect amounts and ratios and nothingyou don't which means no sugar now I andothers on this podcast have talked aboutthe critical importance of hydration forproper brain and body functioning even aslight degree of dehydration candiminish cognitive and physicalperformance it's also important that youget adequate electrolytes theelectrolytes sodium magnesium andpotassium are critical for thefunctioning of all the cells in yourbody especially your neurons your nervecells drinking element dissolved inwater makes it very easy to ensure thatyou're getting adequate hydration andadequate electrolytes to make sure I'mgetting proper amounts of hydration andelectrolytes I dissolve one packet ofelement in about 16 to 32 ounces ofwater when I wake up in the morning andI drink that basically first thing inthe morning I'll also drink elementdissolved in water during any kind ofphysical exercise I'm doing especiallyin hot days when I'm sweating a lotlosing water and electrolytes they havea bunch of different great tastingflavors of element my favorite is thewatermelon although I confess I alsolike the raspberry and the Citrusbasically I like all the flavors andelement has also just released a newline of canned sparkling element sothese aren't the packets you dissolve inwater these are cans of element that youcrack open like any other canned drinklike a soda but you're getting yourhydration and your electrolytes with nosugar if you'd like to try element youcan go to drink element spelled LMnt.comhuberman to claim a free element samplepack with the purchase of any elementdrink mix again that's drink element.comhuberman to claim a free sample packI'll never forget in middle school beingat some assembly and um a kid had gotdown on all fours behind me and someonepushed me yeah oh yeah that game I stoodup and Kevin gasman was just sittingthere just cackling with his face rightin front so I hit him it turns out itwasn't Kevin that did it and he hit meback and it was a disaster and I don'tremember how it panned out but we endedup being friends it kind of how thingsgot worked out well that's rightconflict and cooperation you need thetwo together incredibly embarrassingboth for getting pushed over and forhitting the wrong kid but credit forhitting somebody that's how boys workthings out I'm not suggesting people dothis not not suggesting violence andthen both of us feeling silly and thenultimately yeah well I don't know I madeit to the eth grade somehow right that'sright um and the hierarchy among Imostly had male friends um but thehierarchy was something that was um veryDynamic yeah uh I have a good friend whowas a he was a COO commanding officer inone of the East Coast Seal Teamsquadrons to one Seal Seal Teamsquadrons he said the reason they're soeffective in those those groups isbecause they um Embrace Dynamicsubordination where people take over asdifferent skill sets are required andand they are relentlessly hard on eachother this is something they likerelentlessly hard at the level of humorbut also I mean because it's so highcons high risk and high consequencethey're just extremely hard on oneanother but it's all about this Dynamicsubordination that sure they are leadersby virtue of who's appointed leader umand certain amount of authority butthere's this constant Dynamicsubordination and it exists in everygroup of males I've ever been a part ofand it's wonderful and very reassuringto me because it means that you both getto potentially step up but you also getto rest when you and trust somebodyelse's skills I don't know how itoperates with with girls I've only beenum you know born with a Y chromosomethis is all I know but um I imagine itexists there too in different but indifferent ways um so if onlineeverything is fear-based where one isfearing a dog pile like if you say thewrong thing you're going to get dogpiled you kind of wonder why anyoneparticipates at all but it seems likepeople are in there are they are they inthere and timid or are is boldnessrewarded is it only boldness of um Iguess they call you know slamming downwhat do they call dunking on otherpeople I mean and here as I'm describingkids I want to acknowledge if you lookon Twitter X We Now call itin the academic Tech and financecommunity inparticular this is how the men behavethis is how the women behave but it'sespecially apparent that the adults arekind of acting like kids and the kidsare kind of acting like adults so what'sgoing on are We Are we drawn into thisas well as adults and are we modelingthis or is this just um social mediapulling on these strings of of you knowdeep evolutionarily conserved wiringyeah well so first um you know let'slet's let's not be too sort ofmonochromatic about social media thereis a lot of humor there's a lot of jokesthere are a lot of funny cartoons videosand learning so there is there is goodstuff mixed in and even the bad stuff isentertaining in the way that looking ata car crash or a dead body isentertaining people it draws the eye umso so young people are very interestedand us adults too are very interested umit it it you know it draws Us in um butthen yes it certainly changes ourBehavior now actually um there's someresearch on on trolls uh is it is itthat whenever you go on Twitter youbecome a jerk and um um uh and actuallyum no it seems more that what happens isthere's a small number of men always menum who have a personality disorder umthey um they like to be jerks they liketo get a reaction from people they getblocked a lot they get kicked offplatforms and this small number you knowin a real Community probably when youwere growing up there were one or twokids who were like this and they got introuble a lot and they probably ended updead or in jail um but online this youknow suppose it's 1% of 1% of men arepsychopaths so suppose it's this 2% ofmen let's say who are jerks like this umwell online that's who we all see soso um uh so in part it's that the onlineWorld Super empowers extremists andjerks it's also that in the online Worldeveryone is feeling performativeeveryone is you know you might even evenif you're making a joke you have tothink three steps ahead how will it bemisinterpreted so a metaphor that I havein my head whenever I'm online is it'sreally just like being on thin ice likeyou can have fun on thin ice it's notall bad but you're kind of always awarethat you're in danger whereas whenyou're hanging out with your buddies youknow your good friends there's you feeltotally safe and if you accidentallyinsult one of them you know it's like ohyou know sorry you know yep you're rightI'm sorry um and as followershipincreases the ice gets thinner yeahthat's right that's right the right thehigher they go the harder they fall andthen a lot of people want to see want tosee your fall um just want to make onepoint you that was interesting conceptthat what something in sub subordinationDynamic sub Dynamic subordination kindof like a flock of birds but is how itwas described to me but you know Ialways thought in in the you know tierone uh Special Operations community thatyou know people would spend more yearsthere Advance further and further andthat's true too but but this idea thatit's just understood that the hierarchyevolves in real time and the and themore um people Embrace that the betterperforming the group is as a pack yeahnow the word hierarchy certainly takeson a bad name especially like in ouracademic circles hierarchy you know isbad and power is bad bad and thensubordination all these things are badpower you know inequality but I thinkpart of what's going on there so youknow I teach in a business school andthere's a huge amount of writing onleadership and and I haven't read muchof it but um but a key idea that I thatI got I'm trying to remember the authorum is that the the key puzzle is not whypeople want to be leaders it's why dothey want to be followers we really needto study followership and so people arewilling to follow because part of ouramazing human ability is to worktogether groups to overcome obstacles wedon't have sharp teeth we're not verywell we're fast in long distance but notin Sprints um but we're able to worktogether um and when we Face a commonthreat we very willingly seed leadershipto a leader but we have to trust him andif the leader shows that he's anarcissist that he's putting himselffirst that he's benefiting at ourexpense we don't we don't trust him sowhat you need to do and I think this ismore clear males are more hierarchicalthis is true in chimpanzees as wellmales are they take to hierarchy morereadilyum males benefit from having practice Idon't think of it as dominance andsubmission I think what you said isactually more more effective it's likethey need practice like being the leaderof this project and then being afollower because you grant like yeah youlead us on this you take the lead onthis and then something else willreverse and if you have a young man whohas a lot of that experience that'sgoing to be a young man that you willwant to employ when he's in his mid-20swhereas one who never had that it's justgoing to be much more difficult to workwith in a in a in a business settingyeah the groups of boys I grew up withand men that I've worked with and beenfriends with it's always been understoodlike this guy's really terrific forfinding stuff and this guy's great withvehicles and this guy's great withgorals and this guy's that people havedifferent skill sets and and that thegroup together can really mesh um butthere isn't an attempt to be somethingthat you're not and you quickly find outwho you are by who you're not and youfind your unique skill set yeah and umand you you know uh you evolve in thatway by not trying to be everything toeverybody whereas I noticed with mysister and her groups of friends it'schanged over time of course but thatthere tended to be one girl that wasreally dominant in the play session likethe whole time the bossy one right youknow um and even though some stories youknow kids books with that that mainlyfeature boys have that um I don't recallthat being such a big part of my readingexperience or childhood experience likein the Encyclopedia Brown books likethere was like the mean kid and the likebut people would slot in where they weremost Adept so it sort of like naturaltendencies to excel were complimentaryand I don't know what it is for girlsbut online it seems um all of that'serased um so you've got these socialdynamics that are very um heightenedbeing played out on social media withwith girls but boys and men are on thereas well and most of what's on socialmedia is social it's relational so areboys and men being drawn more towardthose sorts of interactions and how wellare they navigating those interactionsis it common for boys to make bigmistakes online and um and then beshunned as a consequence or is this morecommon in um females yeah that that's agood question um life online isperformative for girls a much biggerelement of the performance isperfectionism about the image so girlsspend a lot more time choosing aphotograph editing a photograph makingsure everything's perfect whereas guysyou know like I literally don't noticeif my socks don't match my wife has totell me your socks don't match um youknow guys just don't notice those thingsas much so you're a professor after allyeah AB mind Professor suppose yeah butmy point is that is that life online itdoes affect all kids so fear of missingout is something that affects everybodyyou know Snapchat you see all yourfriends over there and you didn't evenknow that there was something going onso you know boys and again boys andgirls they'll have similar insecuritiesit's more a question of degree so thethe the perfectionism the the playingout the social dynamics to three stepslike girls are playing three-dimensionalchess about social relationships wellbut why did he say that if he alsowanted this when she he knows that sheknows that you know and guys's like whatwhat do you I don't even know whatyou're saying they're barely playingcheckers that's right that's right andagain it's that it's that um uh you knowit's that the early the organizingeffects of prenatal hormones this is notculturally taught this is what kidsenjoy doing based on I believe and SimonBaron Cohen I believe believes um is theorganizing pren the prenatal organizingeffects of hormones on the on thedeveloping brain but on YouTube whereit's my understanding primarily male yesthere's a lot of clapback type commentsum I know this because I have a YouTubechannel um and in the old days it seemsit wasn't that long ago when Rogan washad full length episodes on YouTube thenhe didn't now he does again the thejokes the comment section on YouTubewere like their own show it wasoutrageous it was so good and um some ofthat's coming back now that was it menshowing off their cleverness right Imean like for instance you might befamiliar with jao willink the right youknow this s if you had to draw an Navyse you draw Joo kind of looks likemodern General uh General p modern dayGeneral Patton right and there's thiswhole category of jokes based on Joo whoI think actually has risen to prominencein the online culture because he's sortof like the football coach that mostyoung males never had he's the guythat's going to tell you what to do whento do it and do it even though you don'twant to and just do it and he and youtrust him he's a very trustworthy guy asit were and he's a warrior and he hasall the credentials Etc but there's thiswhole category of jokes like um you knowwhen joaco was born um the doctor lookedat his mother and said it's a man youknow or or when jao left for college helooked at his father and said you're theman of the house now you know jokes likethat you know there are tons and tons ofthese right so there's this whole sothat's very YouTube male type humor it'sit's one hit it's done it gets a ton oflikes and it propagates yeah none ofthis two or three chess moves down thedown the road um so it's very clapbacksometimes in or in that case building upJoo who doesn't need any more buildingup but people do it anyway so things ofthat sort so interested in the in theseum in the Nuance here because um you'retelling me that girls are killingthemselves more they're depressed theirincrease in suicide is larger boys havea much higher suicide rate so boy manymore boys die from suicide more violentmeans that's that that's one of themajor reasons and that's especially truein America where we have so many gunsboys tend to use a gun or a tallbuilding or a bridge whereas girls tendto use pills or cutting their wrists andthey and the great majority of girlsuicide attempts don't lead to deathyeah so are most of the issues withgirls and online use social media it'ssort of um uh it's despair it's at homeanxious sad about self self- critiquingthis kind of thing I mean you're tellingme there's a a huge and I believe youthat there's a tremendous increase Imean he said hockey stick like functionum when we're looking at essentiallycapturing the tip of the pyramid interms of like extreme social interactionso take let me I'm not being very veryclearhere we have these neural circuits thatevolved for social interactions that aremore heightened in girls they're gettingmuch more of it faster yeah and theconsequences are no less and probablyeven more severe than they used to bebut it's still shunning shaming um selfattack and and anxiety depression Etc inboys the neural circuits that we'retalking about are are related to sex andviolence those evolved over hundreds ofthousands not millions of years andthose are heightened so we're scapturing the the extremes of theseneural circuit functions I'm looking atthis through the lens of aneurobiologist is great and this iswhere it seems we're running intotrouble because the the iceberg belowall of that the portion of the icebergbelow those those peaks of behavior andinteractions like none of that'shappening there isn't the um it's allhappening fasterit's more potent and the consequencesare are more severe that's right that'sright I think there's a good analogyhere to junk food where I've heard junkfood or the H you know a cheeseburgerdescribed as a super stimulus um and youknow ice cream is a super duper stimulusyou know it's got fat it's got sugarright and a and a cheeseburger with amilkshake and the milkshake has candy init yeah ice cream and then you get a toyand they're playing music I mean that'sa dopamine bath that's right so if wethink about if we think about about lifein the presence of junk food if youraise your kids with junk food you'regoing to have all kinds of you knowmetabolic problems developmentalproblems obesity all sort of diabetesall sorts of terrible things um now ifyou have a normal development and thenas an adult you you indulge in more junkfood you know it's you know it'sprobably it's not good for you but it'svery different than being raised on itthe the developing brain the developingbody are much more sensitive and so theway you just put it before it's like theit's like these evolved motives yousuper satisfy them with thethese overwhelming quick easy hits um itmay not be so bad for an adult we canchoose to have you know we can choose touh you know pay for sex we can choose touh you know eat it you know eat acheeseburger and a and a milkshake umbut it's very important for kids we haveto see the genes don't have that muchinformation in them but they start thebrain developing and then the brain hasto sort of find its way the neurons haveto find their way Guided by localsignals how to develop and then thechild has to kind of find its waythrough its culture getting a sense ofhow do I behave here and and who am Iand how do I relate to people and it'sall a very delicate process that has tobe drawn out over many many years we weeverything about us develops slowlyespecially compared to other animals andif you intervene in the developmentalprocess and say Hey kid you want theEndo without the journey here you gotake it you're cutting off developmentand that's I think what life that's whatthe phone based childhood is doing wellhere's my concern umum there is a reality to these things wecall critical or sensitive periods yeslet's talk about that um criticalperiods implies that it's open and shutand they're actually sensitive periodsfor language learning for brainplasticity and the the general Contourof this is passive experience up untilabout age 25 dramatically shapes themaps in the brain that we have of socialrelationships of the visual world theauditory world I mean there's just somuch data to support this in animals andhumans then after about age 25 you canpry openen the underlyingneurobiological mechanisms forneuroplasticity and you can rewire yourbrain but it takes a hell of a lot ofeffort Andor pharmacology to assistwhich is part of what the excitementabout some of the Psychedelic therapiesare about because um and I'm notsuggesting people just run out and takepsychedelics but but they can fosterchange they can foster change andthey're either neuromodulators or theystimulate the massive release ofneuromodulators like dopamine serotoninmostly serotonin and dopamine when wetalk about psilocybin and MDMA LSDEtc but that plasticity needs to bedirected so just taking the drug doesn'tdo it on its own okay so leaving thataside uh what do we know for sure weknow that as the brain progresses fromage three four five six seven there areMilestones that have to be met and ingeneral if a kid makes it to high schoolage or college age regardless of whetheror not they go to to hopefully they doand graduate high school orcollege there's aset of Milestones that they have toreach the circuits are going to developone way or another the question is whatare the what are the thresholds underwhich dopamine is released well you Iwould argue and I'll go on record sayingthat if a kid watches a lot of intenseHigh potency violent porn and thatbecomes his dopamine stimulus well thenother stuff probably won't do it for himwhereas if there's a variety ofexperience or more let's just say subtledare I even say healthierright umstimula then the system is the dopaminesystem around cording and sex is morevaried it's it's more of a at least moreof a buffet and hopefully a healthierBuffet right um again no judgment hereof different proclivities but here we'retalking about the wiring of neuralcircuit same thing with food if onegrows up on highly processed very verytasty food for a while fruits andvegetables in their pure form Meat andFish in their plain form are boring itdoes not evoke the samereinforcing property and earlier I I Iforgot to to mention why I prefer theword reinforcing as opposed to rewardbecause reward evokes this idea of thething being the reward but thereinforcement is reinforcement is a verband so as a verb it it brings the mindto the fact that these circuits are arelike they're churning in the backgroundthere it's not just about getting thething it's the um it's the underlying bibiology that that gets you there and soI think that where I'm very concerned isthat we've now got what millions andmillions of kids boys and girls whoseneuralcircuits were wired up wrong and nowthere needs to be it seems a very activeprocess in unwiring that or at leastshifting those neural circuits towardssomething that's more adaptive yeah sobefore before we talk about what to doif you're older because I have the thegreat Good Fortune to be sitting herewith you right now I'd like to ask youum to help me expand what I say in thebook so you you gave a description of ofcritical periods where there's a hardbeginning and end and of sensitiveperiods are periods in which it's just alot easier to learn something and if youdon't learn so for example phology isone of the clearest cases you accent youknow if you you know when a family movesto America from somewhere else if you'vegot two kids in the family one of myadvisers at at Penn in grad school umHenry GL had a very very heavy Germanaccent and his younger brother two yearsyounger had no ACC whatsoever becauseHenry was 14 and his brother was 12 whenthey came to America from fleeing NaziGermany um and so there's a sensitiveperiod that kind of closes at pubertyfor language so I talk about that in thebook and then I talk about morespeculative sensitiveperiod um that I've read about you knowa few people think this exists and and II cite a Japanese study um of ofJapanese businessmen who moved toCalifornia in the 70s as Japanesebusiness were thriving and they lookedat when did the when did the kids cometo feel American and the answer wasif they came and left before age nnothing they went back to Japan theywere totally Japanese if they came uhwhen the kid was 15 nothing the kid wasalready Japanese but wasn't going toever feel American if they came andspent a few years between about 9 and 15then they go back to Japan nowespecially if the kid's now 15 or 16 thekid now feels American and has troublefitting back in puberty well that'sright there's a period it's it's earlypuberty it's you know like just beforepuberty to sort of Midway through PULiberty seems to be a sensitive periodfor culture learning and for identityyour very deep sense of who you are andhow you relate to people so this isspeculative but it does seem to fit alot of interesting data and and thereason why I I focus on this in the bookI decided like late in the process uhyou know I knew I had to talk aboutpuberty I was going to have like asection on I was my God this is soimportant I need a whole chapter onpuberty and I talk about initiationrights all over the world adults thinkkids don't just turn into men and womenthey need help they need to be given thespecial knowledge for boys there'susually orals more so than for girls umand so I think what's going on is we dohave this sensitive period for cultureallearning how do you learn to become aperson in your culture and you know Iwas I was in the Boy Scouts and boyscouts was created around World War I aslike paramilitary training like learnVirtues Of You know self-denial and ohyou know Brave clean loyal trustworthyrever iot the order all messed up but itwas a set of Virtuesum so would you agree or what would yousay about sensitive periods for thisreally high level stuff we're nottalking Vision or phology which arefairly low-level cognitive things we'retalking like your sense of who you arewhat would you think about a sensitiveperiod for that oh first of all pubertyis just fascinating and underd discussedin my opinion as a criticaldevelopmental milestone it's also thethe fastest rate of Aging that we everundergo aging meaning in our you know interms of change of the brain in terms ofum rate of uh I mean there are sometheories that that the that the rate ofpuberty and the timing of onset ofpuberty actually might predict somethingabout longevity oh which way earlypuberty is B early puberty might be badbut I want to be very careful and sayingthat some people including myself have avery protracted puberty so I hit pubertyaround 14 but I didn't get facial hairuntil I was out of college wow so somepeople develop the so-called secondarysexual characteristics slowly but Ialways had this voice since was a littlekid so 5 years old they call me froggynow that's me um and everyone goesthrough these things differently um butpuberty is the most profound brainchange that one can undergo tell me moreabout it because I just keep saying likewell it starts in the back of the brainand then is but be be specific what ishappening to the brain during pubertythat would be relevant here to asensitive period okay so this goes backto the biology that you accuratelydescribed earlier which is that whilewe're in utero if there's a y chromosomethen a bunch of genes are made likemulian an inhibiting hormone themalarian ducts become inhibited um thetestes grow then testosterone issecreted and testosterone and some ofits derivatives like dihydrotestosterone organize the brain quoteunquote male this is dangerous languagenowadays but it's less dangerous nowthan it was two years ago okay wellwe're not talking about gender we'retalking about biological sex here andwe're not talking about the verb sex wewere talking about that earlier we'retalking about biological sex so what I'mdescribing here is is not uh disputedthe so there these organizing effects ofhormones early on and then there're theactivating effects of hormones thathappen during puberty so then pubertyhits the test starts secretingtestosterone um if they fat stores onthe body they secrete estrogen againtestosterone and estrogen working inparallel and in males a number ofdifferent brain areas in particular thehypothalamus but also the forebrain andAssociated areas undergo massiveplasticity in growth relating the withthe for brain the frontal lobe right thefrontal lobe oh so one of the mostprofound changes in puberty that happensespecially in males but also in femalesis that well we can describe the themajor function of the prefrontal cortexthis neural real estate right behind thethe forra has many different subdomainsinvolved in things but one of its mainfunctions this was beautifully describedby the the guy who's now the head uhneurosurgeon at neurolink Matt McDougallis to say sh to the impulse drivingactions of the hypothalamus inparticular hypothalamus houses neuronsfor temperature regulation sexual drivehunger aggression I mean so much so thatyou can go in and stimulate certainneurons and the ventromedialhypothalamus with an electrode and youwould go into a rage wow stimulateneurons also within the ventromedialhypothalamus just nearby and uh you'dwant to go spend some time with yourwife alone let's just put it that way Imean a remarkable specificity of theneuronal outputs to behavioral changeand state change so all of that gets setup essentially during puberty becausethe neurons of the hypothalamus areresponsive to these hormones that arecoming from the gonads and in femalesit's yes mainly secretion of estrogenbut also testosterone okay so the brainis changing in dramatic ways not theleast of which is the forbrain islearning how to suppress impulse okayand some of that gets feedback frombehaviors from parenting how topresslearning how to supress from socialreward or punishment if it doesn't getdaily practice in suppressing if you'reable to give into all your urges cuzlike I'm finding like when I sit at mycomputer my Rule now I have to say tomyself out loud finish what you startfinish what you start no don't go checkuntil you've done you only have two morepages to read read those two pages but II can't do it right well this is thegradual creep of sort of a we don't wantto make it clinical but an adult likeADHD like symptoms that we all aresuffering from right there's just it'sjust we're at a buffet right anddelicious that's a good example so umthat's one of the main things this uhforbrain to hypothalamic wiring theother is and is this not trivial and youmentioned in the context of languagelearning and Dr Eddie changen who's aneurosurgeon uh actually chair of neurossurgery at UCSF knows a lot about thisand critical periods is that theirhormone effects on say like thickeningof the vocal cords which is why onaverage boys have um deeper voices thangirls and so forth after puberty andthere's a lot of feedback from thosesignals in terms of the social worldbecause now a young boy whose voicedeepens who's also acquiring moreknowledge is talking to other peopleabout that knowledge and he's beingtreated differently and there's feedbackin terms of his self-concept and that'swhere it gets kind of high levelabstract in girls there's feedback ofsometimes it's bodily changes positiveor negative feedback from peers othergirls Andor boys but also knowledgeshe's out there talking about well youknow like she's brilliant in math or youknow brilliant in literature and gettingthe feedback and then self- knowledgestarts to accumulate and the thelocation of identity in the brain isunclear it's probably distributedNetwork it's probably an emergentproperty of a lot of different things sowe can't really point to one area butit's learning impulse controlreinforcement contingencies on what timescale can I get what I want to meetcertain drives and to what extent shouldI suppress those drives and you knowtraditionally it was I think throughreligion and parenting and um socialcues that you will learn well if I wantsomething is it okay to do it that thereare consequences to eating more or lessconsequences to be okay so it's supercomplex but but that all happenssometimes in a summer this is what's soamazing to about puberty to me you knowor the acquisition of facial hair in ina boy you know suddenly he's looked atdifferently people will start projectingall sorts of Futures on him you know umbut we do this I notice I'm not a childpsychologist obviously but as soon as myniece starteddrawing she's going to be an artist assoon as a boy starts building or a girlstarts you know gets a math problemright is going to be a a mathematician Imean we project all this stuff and andthere's no question that that feeds backon identity but in terms of online use Ican't even imagine how much of this isdiminished by only showing a specificpart of ourselves and I can't evenimagine how much of it is exacerbated interms of what we are rewarded for duringpuberty so here's what we know in bothanimals and humans which is thatneuroplasticity while it responds topunishment is exquisitely sensitivebecome sort of a runaway train for moreplasticity under conditions of dopaminereinforcement and reward so you canimagine that the girl using the filterthe Instagram filter for who getsrewarded for looking a certain way maybeexcessively thin or something or whatleads to excessively thin um there's noquestion that rewards Driveneuroplasticity faster than punishmentmake sure I understand this you'resaying suppose a girl gets uh a girlgets onto Instagram and she's nowconsuming stuff about being thin and forsome reason she finds this rewarding areyou saying that the the the quickdopamine circuits or she posts somethingand she gets likes for it are you sayingthat that actually will extendneuroplasticity the fact that she'sgetting more dopamine s rapid dopaminethat will make her more neuroplastic andher brain will change more yes it willit will accelerate learning for thewhatever contingency led to thatwhatever led to that so we know this inanimals and humans even though they'reexquisitly sensitive plasticity isexquisitely sensitive to punishment youknow it only takes one shock learning inone corner of a cage or getting sick atone particular restaurant that you don'twant to go back again but when it comesto social dynamics we know that rewardleads to almost what I would callrunaway plasticity in the circuits thatgenerated the behaviors that led to thatparticular reward I mean it's um andthere are a number of experiments thatthat explain this the work of Mikemerenik at UCSF who largely worked onadult plasticity but showed that whenyou when you activate dopamine releasein thebrain fortunately both duringdevelopment but also in adulthood youessentially create a window of superplasticity okay that's dopamine rewardthat neuromodulator is a window forsuper plasticity and evolutionarily itmakes sense like oh my goodness there'sthere's abundance here of something ohtime to learn something new that's rightwe've we've overemphasized the extent towhich plasticity is driven by punishmentbut the the neuromodulators that allowfor plasticity in particular in pubertyand as adults are largely dopaminedependent and acetylcholine dependent umthe acetylcholine generally increasesFocus um broadly speaking I mean does abunch of other things controls muscularcontraction Etc but so what we'rebasically saying here is that if a kidgets a strongly reinforcingexperience I I'd be willing to bet botharms that the neural circuits that helpgenerate whatever behaviors led to thatexperience are going to be strengthenedin one trial to the extent that it willbe very easy to generate those thosebehaviors again okay so this okay thankyou this is exactly what I wanted toknow to to deepen my the theorizing thatI do in the book um so now this isactually the perfect time for us toswitch over to the four recommendationthe four main recommendations becausethey build exactly on what you just saidthey help me explain why this is soimportantso um so you know I think one one reasonwhy the book seems to be doing very welland people seem to like and pass it onis that it's not just Doom and Gloomit's not just oh we've messed up ourkids oh these terrible devices um ratherit's about a vision of childhood whichis actually beautiful it's the one thatthat most of us older people had it'swith play outdoors and all um and and sothe um my analysis in the book is thatthe reason why I got this far is becauseit's a set of collective action trapseveryone every 10-year-old needs asmartphone now because every other10-year-old has one and you don't wantto make your kid be alone so the fourrecommendations I have are four ways ofbreaking out on the Trap but the firsttwo are really about delaying andgetting past this period of plasticityand you really help me see why it's sourgent to delay until late puberty atleast so here are the four Norms that Ithink can break us out of this trap Normnumber one uh no smartphone before highschool you can give your kid a flipphone flip the Millennials had flipphones they came out fine no access orno smartphone of their own your own youcan't have your own and that would evengo for an iPad if you give your kid aniPad and say here Billy this is youriPad you can keep it in your room anduse it any you know anywhere in thehouse and you can take it outside evenalthough maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever thepoint is um the internet is an amazingthing and you know you can have acomputer in your living room or kitchenwhen you have young kids and they can dothings on the computer but you do notwant to give your child the entireinternet in his or her pocket and you donot want the entire world to be able toreach your child whenever they want toso it's just insane that we're givingchildren even before puberty asmartphone let them have a flip phone ora simple phone watch something like thatthat's rule number one rule number twois the most relevant for what we're justtalking about and that is no socialmedia until 16 there is I believe no wayto make social media safe for childrenthat is if they're going to be enteringa domain in which Prestige is gained byhaving posts that get the most likes andfollowers you're making them be brandmanagers you're making them beperformative this is not playful they'regoing to be exposed to horrible horriblethings I now ask young people is theresomething that you saw when you wereyoung that you really regret seeing anda lot of them have an answer uh my21-year-old Dorman just told me aboutthe gauntlet uh running the gauntletit's a series of 20 videos it's achallenge can you watch these 20 videoswhich end with you know a Mexican druggang dismembering a person who's alivethings like that like yes I'm toughenough I can do that really at what ageshould you do you want your kidswatching people being dismembered 10 11is that and those images are forever forthat's right that's right I didn't evenwatch the video I you know what I'msorry I said that I we provide a link noI'll say that you know trauma is definedas a adverse event that forever changesthe way the brain responds in ways thatmake people less effective in life sodon't do it to yourself like I wouldn'twatch the Dalmer movie everyone wastalking about the Dalmer movie all I hadto see was 10 seconds of the trailer toknow I'll pay money not to see that notbecause I couldn't through it I'm sure Icould force myself to but I don't wantthat in my neural real estate right it'sjust they're for right for obviousreasons so so let's go back to what yousaid about neuroplasticity so because ifif it's true that puberty is a sensitiveperiod for many higher level uh uhaspects of our Humanity such as identityrelationship skills all that stuff thenyou should be extra careful when yourkids are 9 to 15 years old you should beextra careful about what's going intotheir eyes and ears and instead that'swhen we give up all control you knowwhen our kids are little they payattention to us we read to them we havea lot of control about what our kidsconsume when they're toddlers And whenthey're very young but as they reachmiddle school and high school they'removing away they're seeking out otherstuff and that's exactly what we sayhere here's your own device you want togo down a rabbit hole of eating disorderstuff you want to go down a rabbit holeof of you know of you know TouretteSyndrome um you're going to copy peoplewho have these symptoms so the lastthing we should be doing is exposing ourchildren in this sensitive period tosocializing information from randomweirdos on the internet who wereselected by an algorithm for theextremity of their behavior and thedegree to which that extremity earnedthem likes which makes them extraprestigious um so yeah I laws that raisethe age to 16 or 18 I think that's whatwe need um this is just not appropriatefor minors even if there's some goodstuff on it I think it's vastlyoutweighed by the bad so that's andthat's the second Norm no smart nosocial media till16 uh the third Norm is phone freeschools and again you know if we expectkids to learn and learning is brainchange if you're learning somethingyou're developing a skill somethingabout your brain has changed uh howabout instead of learning math orreading or litter or anything else howabout if you just do more phone stuffyou just spend more time in school onTik Tok there was just an article in theWashington in the Wall Street Journalabout a teacher who fought against thephones and finally gave up and quit andone of the students in his classesquoted um that she used to she'd comeinto class and she would just go on TikTok and that's what she would do allclass long is just watch Tik Tok in herdesk um you know and like no you shouldbe learning not doing more Tik Tok inschool so it's just insane that we letkids take the greatest distractiondevices ever invented into the classroomwith them I would argue that they arelearning but what they're learning arethese rapidly reinforced dopamine Loopsthat lead to diminished amounts ofdopamine not just in short periods oftime but very quickly and that inhibitother forms of learning yeah that'sright and the ability to pay attentionright to to a teacher which is not asstimulating as what you're seeing on TikTok there's tons of learning it's butit's learning of all the wrong thingsthat's right that's right so that's thethird Norm is uh no uh is phonefreeschools you have to lock up the phone inthe morning either a lock in a phonelock or Yonder pouch um if the policy isyou keep in your pocket that's not apolicy that's just a recipe for constantconflict with the kids because theycan't help it they have to text ifanyone's texting they have to be textingand the fourth Norm is the hardest thefourth Norm is uh far more Independencefree playay and responsibility in thereal world because what we need to do isnot just roll back the phone basedchildhood and make them just sit and donothing we have to do is restore areally fun adventurous childhood likeyou know what you were saying you knowyou go out on your bicycle you'rehanging out with your friends friendssometimes something happens and boy youhave memories I mean exciting thingshappen scary things happen you havememories and you know I worry about likewhat you know what boys today you know Ihave a group of Buddy my group offriends that I you know we we still talkabout things that happened you knowthings that amazing things that happenedwhen we were in college or after collegeand I wonder what boys young boys todayare going to say you know you rememberfortnite game27363 where you were trapped in thatElevator Shaft and I had to shoot youout no I don't remember that one youknow like uh the the virtual Adventuresare just not going to cut it our kidsneed Adventure they need Independenceand Adventure uh where they work out theconflicts themselves so if we do thosefour things I think we can restorechildhood in the real world nosmartphone before high school no socialmedia till 16 phone- free schools moreIndependence free play andresponsibility in the real world thosefour things and these are things that wecan all do if we work together if we dothem at the same time if you're the onlyfamily that's keeping your kid off aSmartphone till high school and off ofsocial media till 16 you're imposing acost on your child and she may be lonelyand she'll say Mom I'm left out now shemight still thank you as we saw lastnight some one of the women said herdaughter thanked her for keeping her offbut at the time it was painful for herand so my hope is by spreading theseNorms no parent will ever be in thatposition again where their kid is theonly one in the class who doesn't have asmartphone at age 10 to have thisfantastic list I say fantastic becauseit Jes with all of the neurobiology thatI'm aware of and because it offerssolutions that it's really based onknowing what's happened and is happeningwith with smartphone use there are abunch of don'ts but then there's somedos which I you know I'm not again I'mnot a um an expert in behavioral changebut I spent a fair amount of my timetalking to people about what they can dofor their health and well-being and notjust the don'ts um and I I think it'simportant as I understand to havereplacement behaviors and also I thinkpeople of all ages want want to dosomething that feels good the first timeand every time and that's good for themand then you create that reinforcementLoop in a different direction um you'reoffering all of that in the book andhere and it's fabulous what I wonderabout and um would love to help in anyway that I can uh with is you know ifyou recall years ago there there wasthis understanding about the first sixyears of life being critical it was thefirst six years and so parents kind ofoverstepped it a bit and were playingtheir kids Mozart all the time andthings like that waste of time but whatwas interesting is that they werethinking about critical periods in brainplasticity and so as a neurobiologistwho say brain development I I wasdelighted um it seems to me that ifthere was an understanding that thebiology and psychology andsociology points to the fact that thereis a critical period maybe not even asensitive period but a critical periodin which excessive smartphone use of aparticular type is actually leading tomore suicides depression anxiety andless learning and um adaptive behaviorin life it seems to me that it should bea almost like a law it should beimplemented at the level certainly atthe national level what what sorts ofbarriers do you think exist to that umyou know obviously I'm enthusiastic injoining your effort and and um I knowmany people listening will be as well totry and Implement these four things butwhat do you think it would really taketo get people to take their children'sbrains and lives seriously becausechildren can't be left to their ownself-care to that degree it's justunfair right I mean it's like telling akid in a candy shop like Hey listen youknow figure it out you know there'snutritious food down the stre like it'sunfair right it's like a puppy trying totrying to do the you know WestminsterChampionship it's like it's not going tohappen um you know but this is seriousstuff I mean we're talking about thefuture not just of the United States butof the entire species so um what aboutlaws what about legislature how doesthat work I don't know anything aboutthat sure well first so you know let'slet's note you know I could be wrongabout this um it might be that thephones aren't doing this now I think theevidence is pretty good that it is butlet's suppose there's a 70% chance thatI'm right let's Suppose there was only a30% chance I was right the theconsequences are so severe we should betaking action now what action to take Iwas over in the UK for the book aboutthree weeks ago and in the UK you knowand the rest of Europe the first thoughtof everyone is Ban it ban it ban itgovernment law ban and there are timeswhen we need that you know cigarettesmoking underage just ban it like youshould not have kids smoking now inBritain there was a lot of considerationof should we ban the sale of smartphonesto kids under14 and and I met with with the thepolicy unit at at number 10 DowningStreet and I said now wait a second guysum you know as an American it never evenoccurred to me to suggest thatum you need to get Norms first if youpass laws that are out of phase withpeople's Norms they're going to reallyhate you and they're going to resent itso let's start with a norm change firstum and so uh so I think I think that'sreally happening so in Britain parentsare up in arms they really are changingrapidly over there they're a couplemonths ahead of us in America I thinkit's happening right now um and so if wejust develop a consensus we need to seesmartphones in the hands of kids asbeing like cigarettes in the hands ofkids like you know you just don't dothat you don't do that of course theycan be on a laptop they can be on acomputer they can do some things on youriPhone sometimes it's not poison um butyou don't want that it to be habitforming so um so I think that forkeeping smartphones out of the hands ofkids there's no law I don't want a lawBanning that but we just need a norm nowfor for raising the age to16 we can struggle to do that I'm doingthat with my kids I'm saying no for mydaughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16um and she's the only one who doesn'thave it it's painful for her and she's14 um but my hope is that no parentagain will be in that situation that inevery school a lot of the parents aregoing to say no no social media till 16now of course the laws currently statethat you have to be 13 in order to signa contract give away your data and makea deal with a company without yourparents knowledge or permission butCongress passed this terrible law in1998 um uh the Copa child online privacyprotection act it was supposed to setthe age to 16 which is not which is Ithink pretty reasonable but it gotpushed down to 13 with no enforcementit's the law is written such that aslong as the company doesn't absolutelyknow that you're underage they're finethey're not responsible 13 they'remotivated the companies are now the lawmotivates the companies to not know howold children are there's barely anyforbrain at 13 that's right that's rightand since all you have to do you justhave to be old enough to lie about yourage if you're old enough to lie aboutyour age you can go anywhere on theinternet because there's no enforcementso I'm saying let's take the age of 13which is not enforced let's require ageverification which is complicated butthey're working on that in Britainthey've they're mandating that it'sgoing to happen in Britain we'll workout the technical details um so mandateage verification then raise the age to16 that's the one place where I think wereally do need law uh because socialmedia is a social trap and if half thekids are on it there's going to be a lotof pressure on the other half to join sowe need to get that down to like onlyknow if 5% sneak around they find a wayon that's fine umum so that's where we definitely needlaw um and then the play stuff there wecould use some laws so I I co-founded anorganization called let grow if you goto let grow.org um with Lenor skazi weadvocate for returning play to childrenand one of the things we've done iswe've gotten laws passed in eight statesthat say that if you let your child outto play that cannot be taken as evidenceof child neglect whereas at present lawsare ambiguous so if you send your8-year-old out to a store and and thishas happened to friends of mine and somenosy neighbor says where's your motherdoes she know you're out here and thenthey call 911 and the police the policecome because no one has seen an8-year-old un a companied since the 90sso the police come and once the policecome they're very likely to refer it tochild protective services and once yourfamily is in the grip of ChildProtective Services you've got custodybattles you've got supervision you'renot allowed alone with ch I mean it'scrazy what happens so eight states havenow said no no more of that this isinsane um so we so law could help to putto to stop incentivizing helicopterparenting to provide uh uh more spacesthat are safe for kids to play in notcar zones um so the book has the exgeneration the whole fourth part of itis suggestions for governments for techcompanies for schools and for parentsthere's a lot we can do to restore aplay-based childhood in the real world Irealize that some of this is dependenton income for a household Etc but isthere any protective effect of say asummer camp Oh yes um or protectiveeffect of even just after school sportwhere both the kids and the parentsagree no phones on the field you knowwe're not we're not taping for everygoal I mean I love seeing the my friendskids you know getting a three-pointer ata game or something like that you know IDelight in that on Instagram and it'swild that my friends given who I knowthem to be growing up um have these kidsum and the stories I could tell but butin all seriousness it's wonderful andyet I'm thinking they're taking a videoof their kid playing the game um youknow wouldn't it be wonderful if therewere no phones at after school sportsevents so it's a couple ofhours three times a week or once a weekeven where at least these young brainsare exposed to a different kind ofreinforcement burning that's rightthat's right um the British have asaying don't put your daughter on thestage Mrs Worthington uh which is a linefrom an old nol coward song and itacknowledges that especially for girlsfor girls to grow up being looked at andadmired and commented on about theirlooks is just really really bad for themuh but to grow up always beingphotographed uh everything you do andposted online is really bad for them umso yes in response to your questionfirst summer camps are magic never sendyour child to a summer camp that doesn'tban phones because this is the bestchance you have for a detox and I hearthe story over and over again you knowmy I get my my girl got a an iPhone whenshe was was 11 she suddenly became sirlyno longer the sweet funny child she wasI sent her to summer camp the nextsummer and lo and behold the girl thatcomes back is my wonderful sweet11-year-old you know she her personalityis back and then she gets back on herphone and she becomes cly again sosummer camps are the most powerfultechnique known um for a detox becausethe kid isn't being deprived they are ina bunk with other kids with no phonesand they're joking and talking andlaughing and fighting and doing allthose healthy things so summer camp isamazingthe other thing that the evidence showsis that team sports and religion thosetwo things are very very protective so Iwould strongly urge people um toencourage their kids to play team sportsmy kids run trap which is great but teamsports Force more cooperation so there'ssome evidence that team sports are evenbetter for their mental health um thanthan individual sports um you don't wantsuper duper over supervised you knowhigh pressure sports leagues I meanthat's better than nothing but ideallythe more they play games that are youknow more intramural in normal the kidsare enforcing the rules you know all ofthat would be better our kids are notrooted in communities anymore but Sportsand religion are two things that do thatwhat about music I did an episode onmusic in the brain and one of the ummore thrilling and um interesting partsto me was and I'm I have no musicalTalent whatsoever singing orinstrumental or otherwise I lovelistening to music however was that kidsthat grow up playing an instrumentespecially cooperatively with otherpeople in a band you know duet or youknow quartet you know a band um ororchestra or marching band um there'ssome very impressive data in terms ofpotential for additionalneuroplasticity in fact the brainwidenetworks the the patterns ofconnectivity are much more Broad in kidsthat learned an instrument and played itcooperatively than um those that try andlearn an instrument later in lifealthough they're still advantages thatso I wonder if that's could be added tothe list yes playing in a band or in achoir I think definitely should be umfor a while I was really interested insynchrony and synchrony has all thesereally powerful effects um there's awonderful book called keeping togetherin time by William mcneel uh he waseither he signed up or he was draftedinto World War II train training at acamp in Texas they're marching up anddown with wooden guns because they don'thave real guns and at first it seemedstupid to him but after a few days hisunit gets it and when they can theythey're like they're like a unit they'relike like a they're imperfect you knowand it was it was like a loss of self itwas ecstatic and so he goes off to WorldWar II he writes comes back and writesabout you know men in battle he writesthat's a different book different booktitle but but these the but those sortsof being in sync those experiences theywe are an ultrasocial species much we'remuch more social than dogs orchimpanzees we have this ability to keeptogether in time and do thingssynchronously and all around the worldthat's what rituals used to do it'sthrilling and so um um theseself-transcendent experiences that youget from singing in a choir from playingin a band I don't have much talenteither but I did play in a informal rockband when I was at UVA we calledourselves Pavlov's dogs we were all inthe psych Department um but the firsttime we got it and we were all really insync it was totally thrilling um so yeahthe more you give your kids I have wholesection actually in Chapter 2 of thebook on synchrony and and Attunement umwe you know we need to be in sync andthat's why face tof face interaction isso important whereas when you'recommunicating on on Instagram or anysocial media it's asynchronous you don'thave the the automaticAttunement can I get a little new Agyspeculative all right let's go I have aquestion soum I've heard you and others say thatyou know kids and probably adultsnowadays are not familiar with what itis to be bored there's always an inputmovie um on social media YouTube there'salways words streaming at us in audio orwritten um there's this concept that Ilove from the world of mindfulness whichused to be considered new Agy but now Ithink every academic campus has at leasta few grants focused on meditation andits benefits and respiration breath workand its benefits so we' come a long waybut there's this concept ofwordlessness of The Importance of Beingin states of wordlessness where we'renot reading we're not thinking incomplete sentences we're not um takingin sensory information and we underthose conditions are able to actuallyregister how we feel about things likewe become better tuned to um sense ourenvironment and input when it comes andI wonder because my experience of socialmedia has been whether ornot kids are on Instagram Snapchat Etcand they're doing it out of whatevercompulsion have addiction whatever youwant to call it but I'm not sure itfeels good to them I'm not sure it doesI'm not sure it's like the ice creamthat tastes delicious I think it mightstart that way and occasionally you knowthey'rejackpots right but that in large partadults but since we're talking aboutkids let's talk about kids in this verycritical sensitive period of Lifeare not feeling good and they might noteven know they're not feeling goodthey're just compulsively there I'musing the term loosely not clinicallycompulsively engaging and so I wonderwhether or not there's some benefit tokids not just being bored forexperiencing boredom sake but learningto actually be a better sensor of whatthey like and don't like because when Italk to my niece or I talk to otheryoung people now they they seem to belike becoming increasingly aware of howmuch some of the online stuff sucksthat's the language they're not like ohit's awesome don't take it away from methey're like I don't want to miss outbut it's also painful to them it's Imean it's like they're drinking from afire hose of nails and then every oncein a while there's something that tastesgood it's it's not like they're likethis is so cool and that's so cool butof course if you give them a really coolvideo of a animal thing or a socialdynamics thing or a war game or whateverthey'll get excited but I don't get theimpression that they're like this isawesome it's more like this has me bythe short hairs it's got me scruffed andI'm just doing it and I don't know howto stop that's that's and that'scertainly the way sorry the certainlythe way that boys reach out guys youngguys typically reach out about theirporn addictions I hear about thisthousands of messages help me get overthis so I refer them to our episode onaddiction by Dr Anna lmy from Stanfordyeah she's amazing yeah that episodeyeah she's she's spectacular or um it'sjust they're desperate they're desperateso I don't see it as all pleasure I seeit as mostly pain that's right sothere's a lot going on going on here umfor some for some of them they areaddicted and they feel bad for thereasons you were talking about dopamineovershoot or they feel bad when they'renot doing the addictive activity so theyare compulsively using it just like a agambler if you're addicted to slotmachines your life sucks you've spentall your family's money you're ashamedof what happened you feel terrible ohbut if I just get back into the Zone onthe slot machine I feel good for thattwo or three hours that's the mostdangerous addiction cuz as it's beendescribed to me I'm fortunately not agambling addict addict excuse me theGambler really does believe that thenext one could change everything rightit's going to it's going to causemotivated reasoning it's going to causehopefulness that is dashed um so forsome of them it is a kind ofself-medication as soon as the boys movetheir social lives onto video games andporn and the girls move their social Livon social media both sexes got reallylonely um it's you know they're gettinglots of cheap and easy stimulation butit's not satisfying so what do they donow that they're lonely and anxious wellsometimes they do more of it um so someof it is driven by that feedback cyclethat they're now uncomfortable so theyneed more of it but the other part isthe compulsion to consume becauseeveryone else is and they have to keepup and so my students at myyu I askedthem you know okay you know some of youare spending four or five six hours aday on social media why don't you quitoh why I can't because you know I haveto know what what everyone's talkingabout I have to see the latest video Ihave to keep up with it um and since youknow like I can't deal with my email andmy text like those two combin that'smore than I can handle in a day I can'tstand it I can't imagine having fivePlatforms in addition and most I don'tknow the exact number but very few of mystudents are on a single platform mostof them are two on two or threeregularly plus email and and texting andyou know Snapchat um so it is kind oflike like imagine you know food is greatbut imagine always having to eat youhave to always be eating like our systemcan't handle that you know imagine aplant always in a shower like the youknow it's always like no you need youneed times of taking in and Times ofdigesting or processing um one of themost valuable uh I'll I'll tell you twoof the most valuable exercises that wedo in my flourishing class at myu thefirst is uh a prerequisite to everythingelse is they have to regain control oftheir attention and once they understandthat they've given away almost all oftheir attention any moment that isn'ttaken up by you know a teacher orsomething is it's it's the phone for alot of them because there's so much toprocess they have so many directmessages so many group texts they haveto always be processing or they theyfeel like they you know they're they'rebeing left behind they're notparticipating so I make them see you'vegot to regain control of your attentionyou've got to shut off almost allnotifications you leave on Uber becauseyou want Uber to interrupt you to saythe car is 3 minutes away that's goodbut how many other companies is it thatimportant that they interrupt you veryvery few so shut off almost all yournotifications get social media off yourphone if you need to use it you can useit on your computer but don't alwayshave it so in every like you know at atNYU in any elevator as students studentsget on the elevator the phone comes outbecause that's like 30 seconds and it'sawkward take the phone out scroll Iwould argue the professors too yeahthat's true we do not you I'm spend timewith you in an elevator yet but no we dowe do but it's it's it's less it's yeahyeah um and then the other one that Idid um that I is really memorable and Italk about this in the book um is an awalk and um I got this idea my frienddaker Kelner he and I did research on along ago and he really continued hewrote this amazing book called a um andthere was great episode if you justGoogle uh Kelner and uh tippet so withChrista tippet he did this greatdiscussion he talks about um how he usedall walks to help him process hisbrother's early death fromcancer and just walking in a beautifulenvironment walk a little more slowlythan usual don't have anything in yourears don't be listening to music don'teven bring your phone and just noticeand it's magical it's amazing whathappens when you do that um and for alot of my students they've never donethat because they have to take in somuch stuff if I'm going from point A topoint B of course I'm going to belistening to a podcast or or or you knowscrolling on my phone while I'm walkingand a lot of them they really had thesetransformative experiences you knowwe're right on Washington Square Park atmyu where around Washington Square Parkwhich is a gorgeous gorgeous Park it'sreally one of the most beautiful inAmerica certainly one of the mostbeautiful Urban Parks I'd say um and thestudents who did their all walk throughthe park a lot of them have these justamazing experiences it's almost likelike a like their heart is opening theyfeel more love for people they theiranxiety goes down and so ever since theyand so I did that myself and when Isigned it I did it too and I had thatsort of experience so now you know I Ilove my airpods they're amazinglyconvenient but I listen listen to them alot less now like when when I'm walkingin New York City I often just justnothing just nothing just look processthink so yes I think young people aretaking in way too much stuff totalquantity of btes is just you know 10times what it should be and they don'thave time to process they don't havetime they to develop an interior life toto think things through so we just gotto cut it cut it wayback if I step back from everything thatyou've said thus far and it's in yourbook it seems as if until 2012 or sowhat was rewarded in youth set us up fora more adaptive adulthood but noweverything that's being rewarded inyouth except from schools and teachersand parents but what's you know beingrewarded on a momentto moment basis forMo the majority of the Waking Life ofthese young people is maladaptive yeahthat's right I mean it's it's so Starkthat's right think about it this way umand imagine that your children arehaving a life out in the real worldthey're having Adventures they're doingthings they're building forts in theforest they're doing all sorts of thingsand then one day you know a casino opensup nearby and it welcomes all the kidsand that's where they spent all theirtime is in a casino and they're in thecare of a company that is trying toextract as much money as it can fromthem and that's what they do eight or 10hours a day it's an Abomination to thinkthat a casino could own our children'schildhood what if it wasn't a casinowhat if it was a brothel for the for theboys would be more of Interest let's saylike again inconceivable that we wouldlet that happen but what we've done iswe've said well what if it's Snapchatwhat if it's Instagram what if it'sFacebook well not so much Facebook whatif it's Tik Tok these companies theseare the some of the largest and mostpowerful companies in the world theyessentially own our children's childhoodthis is where childhood is taking placeon a few giant PL for-profit platformswho that use an Advertising basedbusiness model so they are motivatedlike the Cino to keep them in don't havea clock don't let them see what time itis keep them in don't let them clickover to a link to another site keep themin um we somehow have seeded ourchildren's childhood to Giant companiesthat have shown that they don't reallycare about our kids welfare they caremuch more about profitability and andthey care about their customers who arethe advertisers and these companies havebeen granted a special RIT from the KingCongress said in in in the in section230 of the communications decency act in1996 I think it was Congress said oh andnobody sue you nobody can sue you forwhat you show to their kids uh there wasa reason for that that you don't wantAOL to be responsible for everythinganyone posts but it's been so broadlyinterpreted that so far any attempt toregulate social media or any attempt tosue them is seen as like no no so youknow it's just we somehow slipped intothis and once you see it that way thatit's as though our kids are being raisedin hara's Casino you know like like nowe've got to stopthis last year I had the opportunity tospeak to to some of the groups at thesecompanies that are assigned tocontrolling the well-being of the youngpeople that use their platforms and themajor emphasis was on the type ofcontent so protecting them against childPredators protecting them againstpornography um but as you recall at thebeginning of the conversation we brokethings down into variables of timespecific content Dynamics and maybe thevisual interface itself I think for sakeof today's discussion the visualinterface is probably the leastinteresting but I can just tell youlooking things up close uh a lot notgood the eyeball lengthens you becomenearsighted which is why spending twohoursoutside um even if on a tablet has beenshown to offset myopia and oh wowthousands of people children anywaythere's that piece but the time piece isinteresting right maybe limiting thetotal amount of time on social mediaobviously the content issue is it onlytakes one exposure to a video of thesort that you described The Gauntlet Inever want to see it whatever has to bedone to my phone so that I never see itplease uh let me know um but it justseems as if this has been allowed toit's like it's almost like an IV drip ofglucose or something happening in thebackground we're saying okay just stayrigged up to um the glucose trip andthen we wonder why we're end up withlet's just say cognitively uh obesechildren yeah that's right the wheneverthere's New Media um The public'semphasis is always on the content andand so with television the emphasis waswell violence on TV is this going tomake them violent and it turns out notreally watching violent on violence onTV doesn't really make you violent andvideo games these violent video gamesthese firstperson shooter games arethese going to make our kids intokillers and there was a lot of researchon that it looks like no it doesn'treally it doesn't really do that and somany researchers then say see it's justa moral Panic it's okay but that is butthat's focusing on the content and thiswas the great lesson from Marshall mclanand Neil Postman and all these greatmedia theaters in the 20th Century ummcluen said the medium is the messagedon't Focus so much on the content ofTelevision focus on the transformationof human life when the televisionbecomes the family Hearth and people sitaround watching it now from our vantagepoint today that's pretty darn socialthey're sitting with their familymembers together ex having an experiencebut mcl's point was that's thetransformative thing the the what thetechnology does it's not the content andso in the same way a life on socialmedia in some ways it's like televisionyou're watching stuff but it's much morebehaviorist with television you didn'thave the constant I do something I'mrewarded I do something I'm rewarded soso social media is much much moreaddictive than television ever wasthat's one aspect of the uh televisionis not performative it doesn't makeyou live your life in front of a camerayou're not in front of a camera you're apassive recipient whereas social mediaputs our kids in front of a camera um soin all these ways we we get distractedand and this is the the way you know inthose Senate hearings uh it was allfocused on content you know can't wecan't we reduce the you know the numberof beheading videos and the childpornography suppose we you know can't wereduce that by 90% wouldn't that begreat you know Senator we have the youknow World leading technology and doingthis um yes that would be nice to forour kids to see less hardcore porn andand less violent videos that would benice but if if we could make Instagramjust be happy girls living beautifullives and our daughters were to watch 8hours a day of this is that good forthem hell no so you know it is importantto clean up the content but for kidsgoing through puberty I think the onlyreal answer is just delay just don't letthem do that how much of the issue hereis modeling of what adults are doing andum you know and how terrible are or goodare adults at modulating their behaviorI say modulating because you know I seea lot of parents um videotapingeverything that they're you know on thephone all the time in line at the storewhile their kids are around you know andone of the reasons I think parents likedivices so much is that it's a terrificuh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter itallows them to then go be on theirphones or do other things yeah so youngchildren are sometimes copying theirparents young children are looking forthings to copy uh and you know and so II've got some slides in my regular booklecture of toy iPhones that we give toTod ERS so they can be just like Mommyand Daddy um for little kids I think itmight matter for teenagers you know I'mvery often asked that question becauseand I think it's because parents theyfeel a little guilty like they know thatthey're modeling bad behavior andthey're worried like is this setting upmy kid for doing that and I can't sayfor sure but my intuition as a socialpsychologist is not really not very muchand the reason is because you know whileyour kids once looked up to you and theyonce copied you like by the time they're12 13 14 you know if I pick up if Istart reading you know the economist Mamagazine where if I start knitting orwhatever that's not going to make my14-year-old daughter want to do thosethings because I'm doing them she iscompletely focused on what her peergroup thinks of her of course she isthat's that's the nature of teenage foodthey're moving away from the familythey're trying to make their way ontheir own in a pure group Lisa deur isis great on on these issues um so Idon't you know it would be nice ifparents could improve their phone habitsand boy phones at the table that's animportant place that is a very importantPlace get across the idea that whenwe're eating we're with each other we'relooking at each other and we're tastingour food we're experiencing the food soactually there modeling Collectivebehaviors like a meal I think that isactually very very valuable but if it'sjust that you know you're oftenmultitasking you're often on your phoneyeah you know be nice if you didn't butthat's not going to push your kid overinto phone addiction so the list of fourthings that you provided are terrificthey are somewhat enforcementfocused um as I recall and maybe this isnot true but as I recall one of the waysthat uhmedia was effective in getting kids tostop smoking was to pit them againstthese um wealthy old white men who werein rooms filled with smoke writhingtheir hands together cackling about theamount of money they were makingstealing um the health of young peoplewhereas telling teenagers that smokingwas bad for them did veryso is there a way to create a rebellionof ss against the smartphone um becausekids love to Rebel teens love to Rebelnot but first of all they don't anymoreum oh no really but they're just they'rejust much more passive I don't thinkthey they're they're Authority focusedthey're not as rebellious as as theyused to be that's disappointing yeah nowof course now we'd have to pit themagainst a group of you know young whitemen who are owning the social mediacompanies I suppose um but you know thisis this addiction is very different fromtobacco or anything else tobacco isbiologically addictive um and you can'tget an entire High School addictedbiologically at least it's very itdidn't happen um in the peak year ofsmoking was 1997 37% of American HighSchool students smoked two-thirds didn'tbut with social media you couldn't havethat you couldn't have just a third it'seither none or everybody and it'severybody and it happens in middleschool so the Dynamics of a social mediaaddiction are so it's a social addictionmore than a more than a like you knowbiochemical like nicotine or cocainetype typeaddiction so I think the way to breakout isn't hey these people areexploiting you that might be helpful weshould definitely study that I think theway to break out is okay look you guysactually you can see what this is doingto you you mostly agree that this iswasting your time it's garbage you youwant to way out but you just feel likeyou can't there's suchresignation um but look the cool kidsover there they have flip phones andthey're out like every day after schoolthey're like you know they're doingstuff they're down at you know they'rein the mall they're they're gettingpizza they're you know building a fortuh you know whatever depending on theage um so I think the way out is to givekids an exciting childhood kids are solonely now and and they they don't havemuch in the way of Adventure they don'thave much in the way of Thrills um youknow you know I live I live in New YorkCity um you know I would start I wouldlike bring my kids out to Coney Islandwhen they were you know 9 10 years oldbring them out and then I would just sayI'm just going to sit here you guys runaround you guys go have fun like I'm notgoing to be with you you know you knowyeah there's a chance you'll getkidnapped or struck by lightningalthough lightning is more likely um soand then it you know and then it gotonce they were you know in more you knowlike like 13 now they can actually takethe subway out to Coney Island with afriend so um that's cool I think that'sthe way to do it don't make it likewe're going to take away all this stufffrom you hahah now you have nothing todo make it more like I'm not trying tohurt you here I want you to have fun theway I did and the way your grandparentsdid we all had human F childhoods fullof Adventure I want that for you and Ithink most gen Z will Embrace that theyjust don't want to do it alone so thekey is if you're listening to thispodcast and if you have kids that are inelementary middle school be sure to talkwith the parents of your kids friends soif if you want to make some changes inyour phone policies if four families doit together now your kids's not going tofeel left out or deprived and be sure togive them something give them say hereyou know what every how about everyFriday let's call it free free playFriday no piano lessons on Friday nonothing on Friday Fridays you all gettogether you can start at anyone's housego out do what you want we'll even youknow we'll give you you know we'll giveyou more allowance or we'll give youmoney to spend but go have experiencesthen it's fun it's notdeprivation I love the uh trust in kidsto sort things out and to be safe enoughum at least the statistics say thatthey're more likely to thrive underthose conditions than to be kidnapped orhave something terrible happen I I likeit also because it merges uh yourprevious book codling of the Americanmind um with the current book Theanxiousgeneration I have a bunch of otherquestions um but I think the mostimportant one at this stage is howoptimistic or pessimistic are you aboutthe changes that you're hoping for andthen the second question is how can weall help I mean you you mentioned thesefour action items no smartphone beforehigh school no social media until 16phone free schools and to Foster thisexploration and Independence um and wewill propagate those four things as farand wide as we can but I think everybodyparents and kids I'm sure as well wantto know like what can we do so umoptimism scale zero being like youyou're doing this as a last Stitcheffort but it it's hopeless well youwouldn't be here if you thought it washopeless so one to 10 one being just asliver of Hope 10 being you know we gotthis same way we got other stuff I'm a10 you're a 10 10 10.0 yeah and thereason is because I've never seen asituation like this I've been involvedin a lot of efforts to change attitudesI ran a gun control group uh in collegewhen I was you know 20 and that wasimpossible and I've been involved inpolitical campaigns you're trying topersuade people and you can't get theirattention and how do you mess them andit's really hard that's the way anybodyinvolved in social change hasexperienced that that's most things thisis like you drop a spark and everythinggoes everything it just goes everywhereum so all over the world all over thedeveloped World family life has become afight over screen time almost everyparent of a kid over two recognizes thiswe all hate it we're sick of it andwe've just been confused the only realpush back I've got I've gotten two guysone is I am in a normal academic debatewith about seven or eight research whosay there's not evidence of causality II believe there is I you know we'rewe're you know marshalling evidenceagainst each other but but by and largealmost everyone seems persuaded becausethey already knew this they alreadythought it they already saw it and whatI've done with the book is just giventhem some psychological Concepts andsome clear labels and a way out and I'mso confident in part because therevolution started in Britain inFebruary um yes they drew on some of myolder articles but this was before mybook came out um parents areself-organizing in Britain thegovernment is acting they actually havea functioning legislature in Britain andthe and the the government has has ledefforts to pass laws as well um so Iknow it's working in Britain um and Isee it happening here now at a massivescale um the point of the book iscollective action and parents all overthe country are heeding that they'reforming reading groups they're going inin a group to talk with the principalthe principls and teachers they all hatethe phones it makes their livesimpossible they want a phone-free schoolbut they were afraid of the few parentswho freak out if they can't text theirchild during class if the schools areoverwhelmed by parents saying pleaselock up the phones please let my childhave six hours a day when she can listento the teacher instead of do more TikTok um so I am I'm very very confidentthat childhood is going to look verydifferent within two years I don't meanthat it won't be seven-year-olds onphones but in the same way that weflipped on smoking we used to think itwas okay to smoke in an airplane uh weused to think it was okay to smoke inrestaurants it was okay to smokeeverywhere we thought um and now wedon't we don't think that anymore thattook a long time to change but it didchange I think because of the publicdisgust with seeing children justspending their childhood looking at ascreen and because the public disgustwith what we've heard about meta and andTik Tok and a few of the other companiesum I think within two years it's goingto be widespread it'll be a norm thatyou just don't give kids social media inparticular I mean iPads are complicatedbecause you know you want kids you towatch movies is okay stories are goodI'm not saying the you know iPad is aterrible thing but um our attitudesabout this are going to change radicallyum and I think the great majority ofschools are going to be phone freewithin two years um and we're going tosee we're already seeing more kidsoutside lot every day I get I get emailsfrom Greatful parents saying you knowbecause of your book me know mysix-year-old he wanted to ride hisbicycle down to the end of our cesac hewanted to ride down Circle and come backand I never would let him because I wasafraid that what what would theneighbors say but once I read your bookI decided to let him and he was soecstatic he kept doing it and doing itand now he's going further and he ridesto his friends houses so people in herneighborhood now they're seeing a kid ona bicycle and if Suppose there were 10kids doing it well now it's normal so wecan renormalize human childhood in thereal world where our kids get the chanceto have independent adventures and learnhow to beself-supervised adults ultimately we cando this okay so you're a 10 out of 10 onthe optimism scale what can we do tofacilitate and accelerate this wholeprocess so once we understand that thisis a collective action problem thatwe're all stuck in this because everyoneelse is stuck and we can't leave ifwe're the only ones once we understandthat now you see the the the key iscollective action and so or talk to yourfriends about this talk about the bookwith them you don't have to buy the bookjust go to anxious generation.com wehave all kinds of resources I have videoyou I have talks where I've summarizedthe book in in videos um talk about itwith your with your friends talk aboutit with your family uh uh talk aboutwith other parents at the school ifyou're on social media social media isgreat for adults who want to pursueprojects I just don't think it's goodfor kids to be pursued by the socialmedia companies but if you're Instagramin particular that's where a lot ofparents are especially mothers um talkabout these issues say you're going tolet your kid have some freeer rangechildhood you're going to try to dothese for Norms um and then if you'reable I hope that you'll support theprojects um if you go to anxiousgeneration.com there's a donate buttonum NYU has it set up so that people candonate into a research account for meand that's what I use to hire to pay mysmall staff I have about 4 five peopleworking for me and I hope to grow thatto 10 um I hope people donate to to meat anxious generation.com or to let growum this wonderful organization that thatadvocates for giving playback andIndependence back to kids let grow.orgum and if you know influential people ifyou know state legislators um not a lotof there is some oh and in Congressthere is a very important bill kosa thekids online safety act contact yourlegislators about that say you supportkosa it could be coming up for a votevery very soon this is the one piecethat really could get through the USCongress beyond the Congress a lot ofstates are acting which is very very EXin so make your views known to yourstate legislators if you know them orthe mayor or Governor if you know themum this is a collective action trap theonly way out is together so if we acttogether we can break this terrific andwe'll put links to all of those thingsyou just mentioned in the show notecaptionsJonathan you're bringing the humanityback uh it's it's remarkable and youknow as a fellow academic I have to sayyour depth of scholarship in terms ofdeveloping and researching these ideasbut also the Vigor and the mission thatyou have around doing good and makingsure that it happens soon as opposed towaiting another 10 years and seeing justhow bad this this can get um is reallyinspiring um I feel it I know for surethat people listening and and watchingfeel it and so I want to thank you fordoing this work uh again I lovedcoddling in American mind because itjust woke me up to how how much thingshad changed and were changing and it'ssuch an important book and the anxiousgeneration is truly an important bookand I don't say that lightly um it'sMission driven goal driven and it hasactionable items that I'm certain manypeople

      <td>there's no doubt that AI has been takingthe world's by storm and now it'sfinding itself in the mental healthspace with 1.6 million Canadians youththat struggle with their mental healthwhat do we know about AI use in mentalhealth how do youth find themselves inbeing in the mental healththe so today we are going tocover this next slideplease we're going to be learning andtackling different issues based on whatais and how it came to be about versuswhat we think is going to happen in thefuture with mental healthsupport and personal stories aboutus so now I'm going to pass it on toJosh to talk about what AIis we just move on to the next perfectawesome uh did you want to give a briefoverview of the mdfc quickly at all yeahfor sure so hi everyone my name isLeticia I'm one of the co-chairs of themood disorder Society of Canada'snational youth advis advisoryCouncil um so the mood disorder Societyof Canada ormdsc um it's evolved to become one ofCanada's best connected mental healthnon-government organizations with ademonstrated track record for foragingand maintaining meaningful and sustainedpartner ships with the public privateand nonprofit sectors throughout Canadathe National Youth advisory Council ofmdsc it works to not only advise some ofthe council's initiatives but it alsoworks to assist with continued publiceducation and advocacy resource creationresearch andmore um so I know that we already kindof got some brief introductions aboutreally quickly I'm Leticia sat I use sheher pronouns and I am co-chair of themood disorder Society of Canada'snational advisoryCouncil and I'm Josh fael uh heem um andI'm also a member of the National Youthadvisory Council heretoday and I'm Eden I use she herpronouns and I help with the high schoolsubcommittee and coreCouncil and then before we went anyfurther in this presentation we feltthat it was important to kind of outlinewhat we thought artificial intelligenceis to have that kind of workingdefinition for this presentation um andwe Define that uh based upon AI beingthe ability of any digital computer orcomputer controlled robot device oranything like that to perform tasks thata intelligent beings would be able tosuch as humans and ourselves um we alsodefined a more um specific form of AI aswell artificial uh general intelligenceuh AGI um also known as strong Ai andthis is really the AI that a lot ofpeople have really been talking about inrecent months and in recent years andthat that AI that's really able toduplicate what humans are doing um sothese will be our working definitions uhthroughout this presentationtoday so um now we're just going tocurrently discuss you know how is AIbeing used right now we know it's beenin the news being used throughout a lotof different organizations in a lot ofdifferent ways um but I'll actually passit over to Eden to talk about how mdscitself has been usingAI so mdsc has partnered with what iscalled mea and it's a virtual AIassistant that is an organizationproviding information relating to MentalHealth Services for professionals youthadolescence and all categories wherethey hope to provide a safe space foranyone in a crisis but even though thereare sometimes some glitches and DSC andmea are hoping to revolve thoseissues and coming down to another AIthat we've seen being used right now uhis Uno Soo is a 247 um chat botbasically that's been specificallydesigned for mental health and mentalhealth aid um especially when it comesto if your person's feeling isolated orlonely and that someone's able tomessage uh the robot and it's programmedto respond in ways that show compassionand ways that are able to help you workthrough your problems or any issues likethat um kids heal phone if uh you guyswant to tackle that one againyeah so kidss help phone um you know askind of was introduced earlier it's thelargest provider of Mental HealthServices in Canada so it has a verylarge Reach For Youth from coast tocoast to coast across Canada um and kidshelp phone you know being this largeorganization they recently announced apartnership with the vector Institute umwhich is to beginning for them to startusing AI use so while AI would not beused to provide actual support to youngpeople in a chatbot sort of way umthey're implementing natural languageprocessing and that's going to be ableto adapt to learn how young people speakand then this data that the AI is um youknow collecting this data can be used tobuild better programs for young peoplewhile still ensuring that that human andFrontline um contact with a real lifeperson is still there um and then interms of like how AI is being used on abroader scale outside of individualorganizations we've been seeing someclinical implementations and we'll bediscussing that later on in ourpresentation but you know there's beensome studies showing that when you useAI for a diagnosis for examples it canactually be a lot more objective than apsychiatrist who's following thedsm5 um and then you know AI is beingused by Everyday People I'm sure a lotof folks here have heard of like chatGTP um you know even grammarly a lot ofways that we're using it as studentsit's really being integrated by everydaypeople um and Studies have even foundthat people are turning to AI systemsthat were not designed for mental healthspecifically like chat GTP which reallyis demonstrating that there is a demandfor easily accessible Mental HealthServices virtual mental healththerapists or chat Bots are beingutilized by many different people as aquick and easy way to access um you knowmental health support um and the this iskind of happening regardless whether theAI has been trained to specificallysupport mental health related issues sothey're definitely is ademand and I'll pass it over to Eden todiscuss how AI is going toevolve so at the same time studies areusing and know that AI is being used ina person's everyday life and especiallywhen they are feeling down it is helpfulbut at the same time itdoesn't give accurateinformation and when a person doesn'thave anyone to turn to they tend to useAI so Studies have showed this in themany upcoming yearsawesome yeah so thank you so much forsharing you know kind of how AI how ithas the potential to grow in the mentalhealth field we know that right now it'ssuper novel and it's really upand comingum so over at mdsc we did a brief flitreview and we were just trying toexplore some gaps in the literature whatwe were finding for AI use in the mentalhealth field so while we found that AIuse in the mental health field is anovel research topic they're actuallyhave been like a substantial amount ofstudies evaluating the success for AIservices like chat Bots um you know andassessing high risks crisis situationsand being used to connect youth withresources um some of the ways that youknow what Eden was mentioning with Myraand mdsc I know that's happening throughthe University of Alberta it's likebuilding a database and then AI can beused to filter out all these resourcesto young people and really get them whatthey need in a way that might be moreefficient than um you know like a personwho has to walk you through all thoseresources however um there has been alack of data that we found in theliterature regarding youth perspectivesof AI use and mental health and howYouth and younger segments of thepopulation will be affected so whileyouth may have varying definitions ofsuccess um you know this was a reallybig gap that the youth perspectives andhow youth attitudes are towards Ai andmental health has not really beenevaluated on a larger scale yetespecially as we see more and moreorganizations beginning I have to find away to changetheyouLena can you yourmic thankyou no worries um but yeah just to kindof continue onto that train of thoughtso young people are one of the largestpopulations that are accessing AI mentalhealth services so it is crucial thatthese services are implemented incollaboration with the youth that theywill serve this can be done by engagingyouth as research Partners working withyouth groups during the creation andimplementation of AI in mental healthservices and knowledge translation thatis easily accessible to all communitiesto eliminate any feelings of unease dueto the unknownso not all studies reported engagingyouth in the research process aside fromkind of studying them as researchparticipants so we would really Advocatethat the research process kind of has tobe restructured and really focus onpatient-oriented Research youth researchpartners and really getting youthinvolved into the nitty-gritty of theresearch processitself um and then finally one of thelast gaps we found kind of building onsome of those previous slides was umthat the training for AI use in mentalhealth and support specific use so umlike how does this method of using an AIincrease or decrease someone's abilityto discuss their mental health and whatare the issues that may arise um withthe AI if the code stops working asprogrammed um of course when it comes toAI that is a lot of people's biggestconcern you know um there have beeninstances in the US I know I've readread a few news articles where the AIstarted actually kind of presentingreally harmful information um I knowthat with some of these like machinelearning processes sometimes they canbegin to learn about you know they starthaving their own biases and that can bereally harmful for some community soreally ensuring that AI use is ethicalandEquitable um and then you know there hasbeen a gap in how AI technology cansupport clinical way clinical care in away that is still human centered I thinkwhat we kind of saw attitudes in theliterature was that while patients maynot be you know super comfortablegetting their diagnosis from AI there isstill a lot of potential for to beimplemented in clinical care um but kindof building on those gaps I'll pass itover to Josh to kind of discuss some ofthose youth perspectives of ai ai useand mental health which is really thefocus of thispresentation yeah and as um you kind ofjust mentioned that youth are one of thelargest segments of the population we'reconstantly at the Forefront of changesand are one of the generations that areusing AI the most out ofeveryone pardon me um and kind ofbuilding upon that to youth already haveinvolvement when it comes to mentalhealth creation mental health policycreation and input into some of thestuff that uh we see happening in theworld of mental health and clinical carein that speaking from all of our ownexperiences here today in that youthinvolvement in the mental health fieldsuch as what we're doing with mdscvolunteering going out providinginformation to people um education andthat providing some support such as uhthrough volunteering with kids helpphone I'm advocating for policy changeto ensure safeguards for such technologylike AI use in mental health and thatwhen it becomes more prevalent in oursystem uh so all of us are kind ofactive and seeing those changes on thefront lines right now um in more minorways um over the coming years and thatwe expect the uptake an uptake in AI useum both on the clinical front uh butalso in general uh daily lives of peopleas they seek out uh more supportiveresources that might fit better to theirschedule or what they're really lookingfor in that whether that be an inpersonpsychologist or use of AI and other Techuh technicalmeans uh we also know that there's afeeling of uneasiness though when itcomes to this change especially withyouth in that um especially a lack ofknowledge surrounding AI in the mentalhealth field um but then also a lack ofknowledge about what AI is actuallycapable of when it comes to supportingsomeone mental health andwell-being uh when it comes to umaccessing services such as Ai and mentalhealth and that we've seen that there'sa social stigma that also continues topersist in that um especially as AI isstill new especially in the world ofmental health and that um so people whoseek out AI services and that um how arethey going to be affected and treatedespecially in comparison to those whoactually seek out inperson Servicesthrough psychologists or therapists orother people like that um there's alsobeen a really high interest from youthabout how is this going to better uhpeople's mental health and involve beingin that um are the services that arebeing provided through AI going to bebetter or in some cases equivalent tothose as to if you were to seek outinperson uh an inperson psychologist umor other mental health professional inthat uh so there's really an interestright now in what's really going tohappen with this and that um is this astep for that we can continue on or willwe have to take a step back andre-evaluate before we're able tocontinue any further uh with it thanthat um speaking on that note as well umabout uh increasing services in thatwhen it comes to accised support andthat we know that there's barriers thatcontinue to persist with the care thatwe're seeing right now whether it beinperson Services clinical care andstuff like that so how are changes whenit comes to ai's use in mental healthservice providing going to really changethose barriers are they going toalleviate those barriers um come thefuture so that more people can haveaccess to the mental health servicesthat they need through actually trainedAI That's specific in mental health andwell-being um to support their mentalhealth and well-being in theircommunities um I'm going to pass it backto our co-chair rightnow yeah awesome so um that was kind ofyou know the conclusion of what we hadto share today um you know just to likereally Briefly summarize we dounderstand that AI use is super novel weknow that so many organizations arebeginning to implement it in all thedifferent ways that we outlined um andwe really are just advocating that theyouth perspective is going to bequalitatively and quantitativelyevaluated through the research processthrough organizationimplementation um but I think you knowall of us we are really excited to seehow AI is going to continue to sh themental healthlandscape um so yeah thank you all sovery much for attending our presentationand we'd love to open the floor to anyquestions if the audience hasany thank you so much for thispresentation we uh we learned a lot I'mpretty sure it's the case for everybodyhere um yeah I see some people turningon their cameras um my colleagues at thecenter um so I'm just going to go andand hand the floor to anybody who has aquestion to any of the three presentersso go ahead and we have people fromFrance actually so we're pretty uh happyabout that and I told them and I tellthe whole crowd that if you havequestions in French I can translate themso we have a lot of time so don't beshy yeah I can kick us off thanks forthanks for having this presentation Ihope you can still hear me all right umjust curious we're we're building astartup in this space um and we'remaking it particularly for studentsbecause that's we've where we'verealized that need really is for mentalhealth um how do you suggest we bestengage students to like not onlydownload a new app on their phone whichis already like people don't like doingthat but also engage in their mentalhealth like is AI novel enough to belike interesting enough for people todownload and try it or do you think weneed to do more stuffI think that's such an interestingquestion and I'm like so happy thatyou're really looking to incorporateYouth and get that like youthperspective in there um I feel like fromwhat I've seen like with my personalexperiences with like theseorganizations and on campuses thebiggest drawback for a lot of studentsis just the uncertainty so I think whenyou're promoting these Servicestransparency really is key I think beingextremely clear on how AI how it's beingused is the AI chat bot is a chat botthat's like directly providing theadvice and there's not any like humanthere to filter things out is it beingused for like resourceimplementation um I think privacy andlike specifically saying like howstudents privacy is going to beprotected is a really large concern fora large bit of the studentpopulation um and then I think you knowsince you said you're a startup I'm notsure how far you are in that process butI think if you can work with youththroughout the process of like creatingthis AI chat bot and working with themthroughout and really promoting thatthen when you want to get those users Idon't think downloading the app is likethe biggest barrier to studentsaccessing AI I think it's just has itbeen like promoted do they feelconfident that it's been vetted by otherstudents that it's been you know reallycreated with youth in mind um and thenyou know um yeah so that's a bit of mytrain of my thought but yeah you knowjust really making sure that it's youthfocused youth centered and that thoseperspectives have been considered ummaybe I'll let Josh or Eden jump intowith some of their own experience andexpertise yeah I just kind of want jumpin here too and I agree with what youkind of said there and that too when itcomesto marketing or using AI especially ifit's specific for mental health and thatfor students and that what I've seenthrough my own experiences and that umwhere I am right now in my postsecondaryis that privacy insecurity when it comesto so students want to know that the AIis not going to be uh taking and storingany information that that they're in itthey want to know that it's actuallygiving them real advice back the same aslike a psychologist might or a therapistor something like that um so ensuringthat you have those precautions in placeuh before it's implemented and even Jourwhen it's implemented and beingmarketed that that's a great idea Ithink we've touched on a lot of thingsbut uh I'd love to develop with likefolks like you in mine I'm just curiousis there a way to get more youthinvolved in the development of like aproject or an app like thisabsolutely um I know so we're all fromthe mood disorder Society of Canada sowe have a national advisory Council umyou know we can share over our contactinformation emails and everything forthat as well and then if there's everany other organizations that you're likelooking to model after or that you knowwork with you directly um I alwaysrecommend you know reaching out to someof them a lot of organizationsespecially in the mental health space dohave like youth advisory counsels I knowkids help phone has one A lot of them doum so definitely doing that Outreacheven when you're doing Outreach towardslike University students um you knowthey have like wellness centers thosecounselors there's a lot of great clubssupport groups there too that I woulddefinitely encourage you to great greatyou guys up after listen thank you somuch we're not presenting ourselves butwe are the hosts of the presentation andwe also have you Council so bills Peterreach out we have a teens youth Councilwell teens Council and youth that areabove 18 but definitely reach out to them the Society of Canada I don't want topoach uh any of their uh assignments umno opportunities thankyou uh anyoneelse I think we have our ownLena can you hear meokay great excellent thank thank youeveryone for this nice presentationsorry I I disrupted by coming late butit was excellent um so we have a fewpeople around the table I will start thequestion and maybe other questions aswell one of the one of the Ts that Ihave is I have very limited experienceas a user of any mental health apps souh this is a very ignorant question inmany ways but one thing that strikes meis there is a different between using umAI or um anything that is like digitaluh techn technological assistance forwellness and using it for uh helpingsomebody who is going through a mentalhealth challenge in s most of thedigital apps that we see right now arelike wellness focused there's verylimited actual health or recovery orRehabilitation Focus as young people whoare users as well as advisers in this inthis uh field what do you what do youactually think as the difference is thissomething that we need to think moredeeply that you cannot simply take awellness app and apply it to Heth I canthink of one example which kind ofworries me there was this thing calledTessa a chatbot which was introduced bythe eating disorder network uh some timeago and when it was introduced there wasno uh no much concerns about how this isgoing to be for for for the process thatwas intended but increasingly the youngpeople who interacted with this chatbotstarted feeling uh started gettingpsychodynamic reaction to it startedgetting lots of UNC uncomfortable umexperiences from this chatbot which wasnot really something that the the makersof it initially thought about so myquestion is really do we need to becareful about not taking Wellness appsand putting them into the mental healthspace do you have any thoughts on thishow should we go about it if you'retrying to apply AI to mentalhealth absolutely I feel like you'vebrought up so many valid concerns thatwe've seen stem through ourorganizations and through theliterature um I think the biggest thingis like how when you look into theresearch of like how these AI apps arelike being coded through like machinelearning or natural learning processesit's really important that you're codingit in a way that the AI itself is notgaining any like biases because that's ahuge concern um I know that like onestudy that I'm involved with is lookingat the use of AI for like Primary HealthCare Physicians and ensuring that likesocial detriments of Health for patientsare being evaluated but when you're kindof feeding your AI all of thisinformation you have to make sure thatit's not going to start developing itsown biases that it's then going to startspitting out to those to those youthpeople young people who may be usingthese apps so do I think that we shouldbe you know taking these Wellness appsthat may have also been built more umbecause there are a lot of apps outthere that are using AI more for youknow like monetary reasons opposed toyouth support I don't think it's thesame copy and paste I don't think thatwould be like appropriate so I thinkthere needs to be like a lot of likeguidelines and you know I'll let Joshspeak on the policy side of it as wellbecause he's a lot more well-versed inthat than I am but you know all thepolicy work surrounding like what iswhat data is allowed to be usedimplemented collectand then how are we going to ensure thatit's only going to be used in a veryhelpful way so I also know what kidshelp phone like we're partnering with AIcompanies and we are you know we have alot of data from young people but we'renot going to be we're not building achat bot and we're not buildingsomething that is going to becommunicating with young people and thatis a concern you know sometimes we getphone calls we get texts and youngpeople are asking am I talking to a realperson right now so I think you know onthe note of the transparency that wewere talking earlier like letting youngpeople know that you're still talking toa real person this is still a person whohas expertise in their field and they'rea trained professional um but just theAI use you know it can help you it canhelp you triage like who is in a crisissituation right now and who needs to beyou know who needs to answer that phonecall first um you know some of the riftstudies that we were looking at too itwas looking at you know sometimes um youknow I'm a nutrition major sometimes ifyou're an overweight patient a lot ofyou can be depressed you can have anxanxiety but if you're overweight youknow the doctor might just feel likewell maybe if you lost weight you wouldfeel better you know kind of ignoringlike all these neurochemical imbalancesand everything so then maybe AI could beused as a more objective evaluator forsome of these diagnoses opposed to apsychiatrist who might have their ownbiases and you know follows the dsm5 intheir own ways so I think there is somany intricate ways to use AI I think atthe end of the day it still needs to belike human focused human centered careum and I think you can't just be copyand pasting from from a wellness appinto these like really intricate andreally ethical situations um but I willdefinitely pass it over to Josh becauseI know there's so much policy work thatsurrounds how AI is being used to yeahand I know like we've continued to touchupon this theme today of um transparencyand likeability especially when it comesto AI use and how it's being used ummaking sure that the people that areusing it even if it's like a mentalhealth app or chat bot on a website orsomething like that um how is people'sdata being stored like how is itresponding to things how is it trainedin that where did it learn from andthings like that um I just want to touchupon the example that you kind ofbrought up there with with that chatwhere it seemed to have backfired inthat um so in my view a major part of itfor any chapar or Wellness service andthat is at R you want to ensure thatyou've actually tested it first thanthat um making sure that it's actuallyset up properly so that it doesn'trespond in ways like we saw like thatwhere it was giving out extremelyharmful information to youth that wereaccessing the service and just people ingeneral on that um so making sure thatyou have an operation strategy set upfor the AI or Wellness app or somethinglike that before it's actually um outrolled and people access it in that Ialso want to make a clarification aswell so I think that there's uhdifference between health services andthen Wellness apps in that too so umhealth in that obviously the if of yourdoctors your psychiatrists and thingslike that um more the wellness and AIservices in that I think are a temporarysolution in that we don't want peoplerelying on those services for longperiods of time especially if it is likean AI service chatot on a website orsomething like that um we want that tobe kind of a temporary fix or atemporary um access of a resource untilthey're able to kind of get in full-timeto a psychiatrist or or to clinical careor something like that as well um wedon't want them relying on it for toolong thankyou I have a question too actually so Iwas wondering you mentioned before Ithink you're right that people might notwant to be liketalking about all the problems to likejust some AI chat or something like thatbut I was I was wondering if if if youthink that those those those new modelsthat they can serve as a as a bridge tomaybe answer any concerns or questionspeople might have before the access careto sort of like well not well I guessconvince them that this care canactually help them um do have you seenthat maybe already existing um some kindof chat you could use for example beforeyou book a um I don't know some meetingwith a psychologist you could answer afew questions and they could reassureyou that for example the psychologistnot going to force to do one thing oranother do you have you seen anythinglike that or and do you think that'sthat's something that that could beuseful to for youspecifically personally I myself haveseen like services and websites where Iknow better help forexample does like a questionnaire orsomething to match the person to theright professional I know even thoughit's a chat box it's still like somewhathelpful and usefulbut was it using like some form of AI oris it just like just a question thatyou it was AIbased I think that the more informationthat the person has before they seek outthe resource in that whether it's likean AI form like was just mentioned or anactual AI in that but so any informationthat they have before they actuallyaccess the service in that is beneficialum whether it be about how the servicehas used any successes with it in thepast and that um having that informationvery front of you before you access theservice um is beneficial makes you feelmore comfortable on that lets you know alittle bit more about its abilities andwhat it's capable of um hopefullyrelaxing you a little bit so you're notas worried about your data and otherprivacy issues and that with itum but yeahI've been interacting with a person uhin the chat who uh wanted to share hisperspective or his or her um so he orshe is um retired uh director of adisabilityorganization andum um the concern with AI is that youthwill look at at it instead of realadvisors with professionaldegrees um it is an important concernyoung people can often be easily swayedespecially people with mental healthissues or major concerns to professionalparents and lastly um that is I'm sorrythat is it so maybe any of you threewant to comment or just I think it'sit's a just a comment uh from thatperson yeah and I kind of want to solike I said before too and kind of theanswer um from gentleman before and thatwe don't want these AI services orcharts to kind of replace um anyin-person psychologists or mental healthor clinical care in that um I think thatwe need to find a way to uh Market themor let the public know that hey theseservices are there for a short-termsolution or if you're feeling down orsomething like that in a set period oftime uh but to really still continue toaccess those um like that clinical carethose inperson psychiatrists and thingslike that um the younger generation mygeneration and youth really in generalteam tend to lean on technology a lotmore than previous generations and thatso I think that we're going to have alittle bit of a challenge there umensuring that we don't see a drawbackfrom those in-person services andClinical Services in that um but I thinkit it is possible to be done with theright messaging and things likethatthanks can I ask one more question thisis an interestingdiscussion Josh from what you justmentioned I think that is uh there isreally a case to make for um a youthdriven summary of what are theacceptable use cases for AI in youmental health because I'll give you anexample when when we interact with umlet's say we you interact with Belle tobuy a cell phone the first interactionalmost always guaranteed now is with theAIsystem when I do that when I'm trying tobuy something I'm actually okay interactwith the AI system to get the questionsanswered and then you know be directedbut when I have a repair or a problem inmy cellone and when I want them to befixed when I go online and the AI isasking me question I really lose it Ilose the cool and I I guess this kind ofyou know use cases where acceptabilitydiffers for AI to be the first point ofcall is slly present in youth mentalhealth as well correct I wonder if thereis a a democratic exercise that could bedone among youth in M disorder servicesin in your in your group also with withsome of our councils as well to reallycome up with what are the top 10 usecases where first interaction with AI isacceptable where human in the loop iscompletely essential and there will beno trust without without human in theloop things like that I wonder if youalready thought about it or is there isthere a Gap here that you think that wecould all fill togetherno I think that is a a gap too in thatthat we're kind of seeing thatespecially when it comes to what youjust kind of mentioned in that because Iknow I haven't seen any firm case studyin that too yet about uh such suchsituations pardon me um again AI isstill new especially in the forms thatwe're seeing it now though but I thinkyou made a really good case um aboutabout having acceptable uses and interms and stuff like that for ai aiespecially when it comes to healthrelated use with AIand wellness um that's that's a senssensitive topic for a lot of people onthat but also one that has a greatimpact on everyone depending on theoutcomes ofit yes uh so I want to know DC uh how wecan actually increase the ex increasethe motivation for end users especiallypatients to accept the resultsespecially when the results saying thatokay they might suffer fromschizophrenia or may suffer from adepression so they might say that ohthat's Ai and I don't accept it that Idon't care so how we can actuallymotivate them and say that yeah is itthe result just go to the next stepcontact with the psychiatrist or yourfamily doctor do for the furtherinvestigation about mental situation butwe can do that from your perspectiveyeah no absolutely and I think um Ithink like some of the trends throughthe literature has se that it's olderadults who kind of tend to be a littlebit more um you know untrustworthy of AIand they may not trust those results umbut I I really like that you're thinkingabout like okay so you have thisdiagnosis through AI because right nowwith the Canadian healthc care system alot of people are unable to get thosediagnoses they're unable to you knoweven get their foot in the door to thepsychiatrist to get it so right therethere's a solution of AI kind ofbridging a burden that we're seeing inCanada and with these really long waittimes and everything within the HealthCare system so I think if it's someonewho has you know actively gone out oftheir way they really wanted to see apsychiatrist they really needed to getaccess to a primary care provider andthey you know they got this diagnosisthrough AI it might be what they werelooking for but for someone who wasn'texpecting this diagnosis I think ofcourse you know we're not using AI toreplace psychiatrists or nursepractitioners or doctors it's not thereplacement for these people um it'sjust in a way to support them so I thinkthe follow-up next step is like okay ifyou really don't trust these AI resultsof course you're entitled to thatemotion and you still have your right tohealth care and everything as that so Ithink the next follow-up step would ofcourse be um if you want to to see askilled real life human beingprofessional whether that's apsychiatrist your family doctor um andmaybe having them run the test and runthem and let get their expert um youknow their expertise involved too I alsofeel like right now there's all thesefeelings of uncertainty around AI usejust because it's so novel um you knowmaybe 10 15 20 years down the line youknow we'll kind of look at it like whywere people scared about it you know itmight kind of seem like a second naturething but of course when things are newand up and coming there's always goinggoing to be that hesitancy so I thinkone of the best ways is just to keepincluding those like family doctors andyou know and these are the people too inthe research who are involved I know thefew studies that I've seen you know theyare working directly with psychiatristsand making sure that the data andeverything that's being implemented isthrough people who have like real lifeexperience in the field as well so whilemaybe our AI networks aren't asdeveloped yet to you know include thevast amount of experience that a lot ofour Physicians do um in the future mightget there and I think just having thetransparency and letting the patientkind of decide do they want to they wanta diagnosis re-evaluated by someone elseare they are they willing to accept itand kind of go on to the next steps oftheir treatment I think making sure thatit's patient centered would really bethefocus that's a goodquestion it's a good time um I just hada quick question um to see sorry Ididn't see the beginning of yourpresentation so maybe you alreadymentioned it but are you involved withAI in youth mental health like sort ofin the support side instead of likedirectly interacting with patientsbecause um I've heard of AI in otherfields of healthcare working for likefor example filling out the Physicianslike progress notes or clinical visitnotes in order to reduce like the timethat that takes um so yeah are youinvolved at all in sort of helping AI beintroduced in like the supportive sideof healthcare rather than with par withpatientsdirectly I think like for myself andmaybe other folks as well I'vedefinitely been more experienced with itin the support side um you know kind ofseeing how it's directly supportingyouth mental health through like the useof chat Bots or kind of like with whatkids help phone is doing we're not usingAI to provide care to young people butwe're using AI in a way that um is kindof collecting the data for us so then itkind of helps us build better programsso we've been using like naturallearning processes and that kind oflooks at how like how are youth speakinghow can we tailor the language of someof our resource creation andimplementation to be more youth focusedum so kind of more in that support roleJosh Eden I don't know how you guys havebeen using mental health or AI usingyour mental health Fields yeah I feellike no goahead yeah I would say we mainly justuse a for research based in educationbut to help with like the social fieldsand stuff likethat I was just going to say so a lot ofour presentation kind of focused on moreof the um service providing in that ofit instead of on the back end of um howit could be used like in the office typespace of healthcare and that in thoseadministrative offices and that um I dothink that there's uh equal case for itto be used in situations like that aswell kind of with the same questionthough of how is it going to protect thepatient's data because there's a lotmore data and Health Care access that itwould have to patient records and stufflike that to be able to fill out some ofthose paperwork and some of that otherstuff in that um although I do like likeI do think AI would be helpful in inthose backend situations especiallyright now at the shortage of like familydoctors are seeing how they're having tospend upwards of like 70 80% of theirtime just filling out paperwork most ofthe time instead of actually assistingpeople and helping people with theirneedsI was just wondering because I feel likesince there's been points mentionedabout uh people's resistance or sort ofnatural hesitation towards talking to achat a chat box or artificialintelligence like maybe I I'm surepeople have considered and I just I wasjust wonder if you had like um liftingthe burden of of task from physicians inanother way so that they can spend theirtime like triaging and doing and and andcommunicating with with patients um yeahso like AI is taking something else wayso that then Physicians can put thattime into in like their time to theirpatients I think yeah like an amazingamazing initiative and way to look at itI know that one study that I've beeninvolved with um they're kind of lookingat how AI can be used to screen patientsspecifically for their social detrimentsof health and kind of being able toevaluate like different backgrounds thatthey may be coming from and kind ofensuring that even before a family physposition is going to be like seeing thispatient that they're kind of liketrained and like well-versed in liketheir different you know different partsof their background that might impacthow they interpret Healthcare the typeof resources and access that they'llneed um so you know while that's maybenot like doing the paperwork side Ithink it's just kind of allowing forlike more holistic health practices umso that's a different way that I've alsobeen seeing it being used in theclinical spaces for sure that's reallyNoel well thank you are you guysinvolved with the mea chat bot could youif you are could you share some of yourexperience withus yeah so mainly like it's more of acollab experience we've had butpersonally I help them time to time withtheir research and Reporting glitchesand bugsso ma is is active it's one of theseinitial Pioneer chat box from the nbacrightyeah some of you might not know you lookat it it's called M Mira the mooddisorder Society of Canada reallyChampion justcheat I don't know how much it's used incubec do you have any data how much theproblems is usingit any of you no like I'll have todouble check but I'll put the link forit in the chat if that's help thankyou I know I don't have any data rightin front of me at all but we can checkwith the mdsc and some of our internalrecords on that and get back to you um Ibelieve we have there our contact emailhere with um the center that we canforward to you thank you yeah and themirror chat bot too even outside of kindof the with the youth I know that thethe software has also been used tosupport healthc care workers and theirfamilies um I think the support side forthe healthare workers has mostly beenpiloted in Alberta and Nova Scotia Ibelieve um so kind of like the mirrorsoftware it's kind of been featuringlike four major elements the mirror chatbot the resource portal the data set andthe interface um so the chat bot whichis kind of I think what most peoplepicture what they're engaging with it'sthe primary purpose of that would be toprovide strategic resources for usersresponding to the custom needs that theyshare so they kind of like they mighttype in like okay like I need resourcesfor someone with an eaing disorder withanxiety um so like then when you providekind of that unique information thechatbot will kind of filter it throughlike two main tasks one being likeintent detection and then like entityextraction so like the intent detectionside of that would be like where thechat bot is identifying the needs of theuser you know kind of based on the chatexperience do they need resources tosupport a loved one um are they ahealthcare worker that might be facingburnout or are they a person who'slooking for the resources for themselvesum they you know the data behind that'sbeen amazing I think the accuracy ratewas like over 99% so it was phenomenalum and then the second aspect of thatthe entity extraction this is like wherethe chat bot is going to recognizeimportant keyword from a sentence um theaccuracy rate of that has been like alittle bit lower and I think that's whatwe're kind of developing the accuracyrate was still above 95% you know so notlow by any means but um you knowsometimes too I think that's what we'reseeing a lot with like kids help phonesvirtual assistance as well is thatsometimes even when a young person islike engaging through a text sometimesthe way that they're using language andlike there are certain words that maybelike as a as like an adult that doesn'tI don't depending on how you are likeyouth slang always changing and allthese words um you know how can you pickup on something that may not seem as akey word to like a crisis responder butmaybe the chat bot recognizes okay whenthis term's been used um this is whenthis resource could be used or thismight be escalated so um I think thework that Mir has been doing throughthat has been really fascinating to seein kind of like how we're tracking youthTrends as they'reevolving yeah I I wanted to say tell meabout it when you saidslag yeah it evolves every week it'sdifficult for some of us tokeep so I will jump in and congratulateyou for one special thing uh I think 90%of the presenters in all across theworld all across presentations neverhave enough time for the crowd to askquestions and I think you uh had a a lotof time and I think a lot of people hereare happy that you answer theirquestions um I want to thank you forpresenting I want to thank everybody inthe crowd for to be to have been Dynamicandinteractive um we will be posting thisconference on uh YouTube shortly uhobviously we'll uh we'll we'll tell youby email the the youth Council and uhagain thank you very much and uh we uhwe will see each other uh uhshortly thank you</td>

      <td>Stanford Med LIVE: The State of AI in Healthcare and Medicine</td>
      <td>good afternoon everyone welcome toStanford Med live we are so thrilled tohave everyone here today both in personwhich is wonderful and virtually we'vegot our uh wonderful AV team helping usout today streaming this to all ofStanford medicine my name is Mike fefferI am the Chief Information officer andAssociate Dean for Stanford Healthcareand the Stanford school of medicine sotoday we're going to talk aboutsomething you've never ever probablyheard aboutAI what yeah and specifically around thestate of AI in healthc care and healthin general and uh we are really reallyexcited today to have a wonderfulesteemed panel join us to have adiscussion and we're going to talk aboutthings such as demystifying AI byanswering your questions so that's a cuethink of questions we'll have plenty oftime for Q&amp;A both from our audiencewatching virtually and in person we'regoing to talk about the opportunitiesand challenges of thetechnology and uh most importantly Ithink is really talk about what is theresponsible use of AI in healthcare andand and that's a very important wordbecause it really encompasses manyaspects of how we think about deployingAI for ourpatients um so right now I'd like toinvite our uh esteemed panelists to thestage if you would all come up and thenwe will uh do introduction so come on upplease Round of Applause there wego that's what's nice about having aninperson audience you can't do that onZoom there's no like clapping so uhNigam if we'll start with you if youcould introduce yourself hello uhprofessor of medicine uh in theuniversity and chief data scientist forthe Healthcare System glad to be herethanks higel Chief health and thematics officerfor Stanford medicine Children's Healthand a pediatricintensivist hi I'm David Magnus I'm aprofessor in the Departments ofPediatrics medicine and biomedicalethics and Associate Dean forresearch hi I'm Sylvia ptis I'mprofessor and chair of biomedical datascience here at Stanford thank you somuch this is going to be incredible butbefore we start I'd like to share avideo with you from uh Dr Lloyd M uh DrLloyd Miner a dean of the school ofmedicine and vice president for medicalAffairs at Stanford University DavidEntwistle president and CEO for StanfordHealthcare and Paul King president andCEO for Stanford medicine Children'sHealth they had hope to be here todaybut we appreciate the video video andsentiment so let's hear from them nowgood morning I'm delighted to welcomeyou to today's forum and I want to thankour panelists for hosting this importantdiscussion about ai's role in health andMedicine some of the earliest researchAI took place right here at Stanforddating back to the1960s a lot has changed since thoseearly days especially over the past fewyears now with an explosion in New AIcapabilities we're beginning to see thefull promise of this technology as atool with the potential to transformpatient outcomes Advance biomedicaleducation and accelerateresearch without a doubt we're in an eraof possibility and it's exciting toEnvision how AI will impact human healthand scientific discovery at the sametime it's imperative that we remain trueto our principles and Mission as weexplore these New Horizons withAI in partnership with the StanfordInstitute for human- centered AI welaunched the responsible AI for safe andEquitable Health Initiative or raiseheal because we recognize that thispowerful technology comes with enormousethicalobligations through Ray's Health we willhelp guide the responsible use of AIacross biomedical research education andpatient care starting right here atStanford medicine you'll be hearingabout thistoday and as we continue this vital workI want to underscore that it cannothappen without this community today isthe start of an ongoing conversation onewe hope you'll will continue to engagein thank you for attending today'sdiscussion and now we'll hear a fewwords from David in whistle David helloeveryone I Echo what Lloyd said we'reentering an exciting era of AIInnovation and health and medicine andStanford medicine is uniquely poised tolead at Stanford Healthcare we'realready have more than 30 differenttechnology applications that leverage Aiand we will see many more of these toolscoming online in the not so distantfuture going forward I see aaiInnovations advancing what we do inmajor ways AI will accelerate researchbring promising new discoveries to thepatientbedside it can provide decision supportto our clinicians enhancing theirability to monitor patient health anddiagnose disease it will support ourpatients experience by helping us toanticipate their needs and it will helpour trainees practice learn fromproviding simulation opportunitiesdelivering realtime feedback duringmedical training but make no mistakepeople will always be at the heart ofwhat we do technology is a tool and onethat can enhance and extend humancapabilities it's not just a substitutefor the real thing you'll hear moretoday about what we're currentlyleveraging and how we're leveraging Aiand our plans for the futureand I hope you enjoy theprogram now a few words from Paul KingPaul thank you David and hello to thoseof you joining us live and to those ofyou joining usonline I share Lloyd and David'senthusiasm about the promise andpotential of AI and health andmedicine it's both exciting andencouraging to explore how theseInnovations will support ourpatients as Lloyd mentioned it'scritical that we build and encourage thedevelopment of AI algorithms thatrepresent all populations fairlyequitably and withoutbias this is particularly challengingand especially important for ourpediatricpopulation to date AI systems inmedicine have been primarily trained ondata from adults as there are specialprivacy considerations for the use andavailability of pediatric patientdata as you'll hear today we areactively solving this challenge at standmedicine so that even our youngestpatients can benefit from the sametechnology advances while maintainingthe necessary robotsprotections we're only just beginning toexplore what we in biom medicine canaccomplish with the power of theseTechnologies as a digitally drivenorganization we are accustomed topursuing Innovations long consideredimprobable or evenimpossible firmly rooted in ethicsinclusivity and expertise the sky is thelimit for developing and deploying AI atStanford medicine and I couldn't be moreoptimistic thank you for being here andthank you for all that you do to makesure that we are here for those who needus most Mike I'll turn it back toyou thanks Paul all right so I'd like tomake sure that we all remember there'sgoing to be plenty of time for Q&amp;A so ifyou're in person here we'll have micsthat will be running so just raise yourhand and we'll get a mic to you and forthose of you that are virtual uh you canuh submit a question within the link anduh we sent that out in a reminder emailthis morning so please take advantage ofthat all right so on to our panel uhwe'll start with Nigam uh what exactlyis AI and how does it differ from othertechnologies that we use daily so justthis one question could easily take thewholehour but for the purpose of thisconversation let'ssay we're talking about us using somedata applying an algorithm on it inorder to perform a task on behalf of oran assistance of a humanbeing we'll just stick with that I I Ilove it because you're right it couldtake all day and I I think that's areally really great way to uh thinkabout it uh Sylvia i' love to know fromyour standpoint you know AI is reallybecome a focal point of everything youhear today um especially in health andMedicine what advancements or changeshave really spurred thisinterest yes um there's no doubt that AIis having a really special moment andit's going to be with us for theforeseeable future uh I would say themost significant advancement is a newtechnology called generative AI it's afoundation underlying tools like chatGPT and other large language models andso these type of models are actuallyproducing humanlike responses and sothey've totally captured our imaginationon how to use them in problem solvingand decision making thank you SylviaNigam just uh Curious your thoughts aswell so I I speak in bullet points sofour bullet points uh there's data lotsof it we have algorithms to make senseof them we have compute to actuallyoperate over those data using thosealgorithms and fourth and last but notleast we have the incentive to do so sogiven labor shortages given the rise incost finally it's okay to talk about howto use all of these things to makeHealthcare better that's really greatand i' I'd love to kind of hear from allof you uh some examples that you'reseeing at stand for medicine and howwe're using or exploring AI uh potentialnot only across patient care butresearch and education maybe Natalie youwant to kick it off uh so as Paul wassaying earlier um there there is a lotof opportunity to ensure that AI is usedacross the age Spectrum uh and and we'revery lucky to be here on the Stanfordcampus with the school of medicine withthe with shc uh and learning andpartnering and then making sure that itis apply to some of our most vulnerablepopulations in children in pregnantwomen at at Stanford medicine Children'sHealth uh so there's several reallyexciting uh use cases that have beenhappening um one for a long time ourtype diabetes group priia pahala DavidMZ David um Shanker and many others havebeen working to incorporate machinelearning AI into the management of type1 diabetes for children we do continuousglucose monitoring get tons of data thatis hard for Physicians to stay on top ofand so using these algorithms in that inthat program really allows us to betterserve these children and re and servethem remotely so that we're not makingthem travel hours and take miss schooland miss work from their their parentsmissing work uh to come see us so that'sone example another example is uh againwe have a a real focus on thinking abouthow do we uniquely engage childrenadolesence and their families inhealthcare and there are some reallyinteresting complications both with theincreased regulations around aroundpediatric data uh and the opportunitiesto help adolescents become young adultsuh and so we are using natural languageprocessing in multiple different areasto better engage our teens and theirfamilies and make sure the right data isgoing to the right person anotherexample Yer Bennett in DevelopmentalPediatrics has been using naturallanguage processes and AI to supportGeneral pediatricians to better identifyADHD and make sure that they aresticking with the guidelines uh and thenfinally uh Radiology we know is a hugeuse case for AI um so shre Sergio ourpediatric Radiology team has long beenleaders uh in pediatric AI applicationsuh and so one really important use caseis creating high quality medical imagesfrom decreased amounts of data and whatthat means for Pediatrics in particularis that we often have to sedate childrengive them anesthesia in order to be ableto get an MRI or a CT now we can do itmuch more quickly and either decreasethe amount of sedation they're gettingor do it without sedation Al together umand of course decrease the radiationthat they may be receiving so reallydramatically improving care for thesechildren thank you Natalie incredibleexamples uh David let's go to you okayand maybe we'll talk about this laterbut one interesting example to me andit's still at the research stage butwill be implemented soon is the uses ofambient technology different kinds ofImaging that is done in the hospital andthen using AI to learn about people'smovements to be able to tell when likepeople are watching their hands whenthey come in appropriately and you coulduse use that so you could find outwhether when you're introducing forexample Qi measures to try and see ifcertain kinds of activities improve therates of handwashing you'll be able touse AI to find out whether or not thethings you're implementing actually workthanks DavidSylvia um I'm happy to give anotherexample maybe I'll go into the basicSciences AI is being used to design newdrugs design drugs um that have higherefficiency and lower toxicity um a lotof the data around drug design is verymolecular and very structured data it'slike sentences which are very structuredand so they fall naturally into theimplementation of generative models I'dlike to also add that in the context ofEducation we really are leaders in thisspace uh we have had an educationprogram around Ai and biom medicine forover 40 years at Stanford and uh we havea department now in biomedical datascience I'm happy to be the chair and wehave PhD and PhD MD students uminnovating on new not only deploying uhimplementing and deploying theseTechnologies but actually innovating onthe Technologies themselves specificallyin biomedicalapplications thank you syia Niam allright so I'm going to up the game alittle bit I teach in the program Sylviajust mentioned and I'm going to inflicton you what I tell the students uh sothe first thing is a grid of 50 columnsand 100 100rows those 50 columns are our clinicaldepartments basic science departmentsthe units inside of clinical Departmentlike Cardiology inside of medicine andso on and the 100 rows are sites ofservice there's about 89 but let's justsay 100 so you might encounter exampleslike these in 5,000 uniquecontexts and Mike and I and others ourcolleagues are in TDS like we get tosupport all of that and have fun alongthe way uh but how do we keep track ofall of this like 5,000 is a very largenumber so then I'll give you the secondgrid which is literally a 2 by two thinkof the risk involved in any use case andthink of how hard it is computationallyoralgorithmically and stands to reason wewill do lowrisk easy things first thenwe'll do lowrisk hard things first andwe'll get to hard high-risk things thelatest so that might help you a way tosort of Park everything you hear aboutacross the institution and and makesense of things thanks Niam I'd like toshare a couple things um that we'relooking at at Stanford Healthcarespecifically um mostly on the automationside and this is where we talk aboutthat low risk but really high potentialum we're doing a lot of work with umdrafting in basket message responses touh patients there's a human in the loopcomponent so the physician uh nursepharmacist would take a look at thedraft that's generated by uh Ai and thenedit it or not use it at all but it is astarting point which then they canrespond to uh patients uh what's reallyinteresting in terms of a lessonslearned about that is what you wouldthink we would measure time saved isn'tperhaps the biggest benefit but it'sactually uh reduced burnout and improvedor reduced cognitive burden becausewe're actually taking away starting fromscratch it's kind of like if you'regoing to start a novel and someone wrotesome of it for you and you can be likeAh that's a good idea or not but it getsthat it it's a little bit easier tostart ambient voice uh you're hearing alot about this right now in uh inmedicine because wouldn't it be great ifuh you can listen to The Physician andpatients conversation and generate anote so not just transcribe the wholething word for word but actuallysynthesize that into a note at the endof the encounter the technology is hereand we are going to be deploying thatit's stand for medicine so very veryexciting opportunities uh as examplesthat we're doing soum n and so all of these thingsdepending on who youask could be considered low risk or highrisk for example transcribing a notranscription people might say low riskbut then synthesizing could become highrisk and so as we navigate all of theseuse cases you'll hear about responsibleAI life cycle and all of the leaderleadership of our organizations are atthe table in helping us think throughhow do we navigate this landscape whatdo we do first what do we do second Uideally minimizing risk allow us to takesome technology risk but not patientcare risk yeah thank you n that's agreat transition to the next questionabout how do we think about deploying AIin in healthc care specificallyespecially when there's no federal orstate guidance right now and in factthere's a lot of dis discussion in theregulatory space and we're seeing thefirst regulations actually come out ofthe European Union on this but uh a lotof kind of opportunity one to see howthe regulations are going to mature butalso in the meantime how do we how do wehandle that here maybe David I'll I'llstart with you sure uh really twothoughts first in a paper that somecolleagues and I published in sciencetranslational medicine a a few monthsago we highlighted some of thedifferences between the EU system andthe us where we don't have like just onesource of regulthere are a lot of them there tends tobe a lot of focus on what the FDA doesand doesn't regulate but CMS forhealthare systems are probably going tomatter more for regulation jointcommission and other midlevel playerscould wind up playing a rolefunctionally in regulating and oversightof in these kinds of areas States couldstart to play more of a role uh but thenin addition to that sort of Patchworkquilt there's also local oversight andregulation for deciding what researchhas done and putting in guard rails thehuman centered AI Institute that we havehere on campus do decided that as partof some of their main uh grant fundingactivities they would create umsomething called the ethical andsocietal review process where a group ofus do reviews and all the researchershave statements about what they see asthe long-term implications of their oftheir research and their AI research andwhat some of the potential negativeconsequences are and how they mightmitigate them and we give them feedbackon that as they go and we've alreadycollected some data that suggest that wepublished in the proceedings of theNational Academy of Science that suggestthat this actually does have a prettysignificant impact and it's verydifferent from IRB regulation which isvery narrowly focused on risk to theparticipants and this allows us topartner that with broader considerationsof the impacts of AI developments thanksDavid Natalie maybe talk a little bitabout how you see deploying AI at scalein uh the Children's Healthrealm yeah I mean I think you know it'sit's a lot of the same principles thatwe've already discussed and I knowuh Nigam has really been speaking a lotabout the The Firm model which I'm surehe'll speak more to um but thinkingabout you know this the same kind ofConcepts thinking about where is thelowrisk high value and there is a lot ofthem um a lot of areas where we canreally start to Target and thinkingabout how do we ensure that it isequitably um distributed across the agespectrum and what are the uniqueconsiderations that might be that wemight need to think about in inPediatrics in particular um so forexample Le uh learning a lot from fromshc in terms of the ambient technologyand listening and thinking about okayhow does that change when it's not justa provider and a patient in the room butnow it's a provider a patient and acouple Guardians and how does atechnology work then or thinking aboutwith the in basket technology umcreating a it's one thing to create adraft response to a patient it's anotherthing to create a draft response to aparent and the patient or thinking aboutwhat might be confidential for that teenversus what for that parent or who am Italking to and so really taking theLessons Learned um that are so prevalentacross our our organization and thinkingabout how do we apply them to in aslightly different lens with a slightlydifferent lens to some of thesevulnerable populations yeah I meanreally really great points and it kindof highlights how importantimplementation Sciences so everythingthat we are doing in this space requirespilots and evaluation to see how they'reperforming and what what can we learnfrom that and I think that's a reallyimportant point the algorithm itself issometimes the easiest part of the wholepuzzle but it's it's the workflows thatfollow Downstream and how people thinkabout what they're being displayed interms of making decisions um Sylvia I'dlove to know you know we're talkingabout the potential of AI how do youforesee it changing the daily work thatwe do and what will look different yeahI think we just heard a lot of fantasticexamples of that but what I'd like toadd especially again with thesegenerative models is they are differentthan traditional AI approaches thetraditional approaches often will ask analgorithm is option A or option b betterunder a given situation with agenerative model it may say hey have youconsidered option C so that's differentand so we're now in a point where we canuse these models to get you know maybe adifferent look at the problem and it maybe that we don't choose option C and itmay be because we were exposed to optionC we think of option D and so I thinkthese you know I'm very optimisticbecause I see these tools really notonly used to improve efficiency but alsoaccelerate ourcreativity yeah thank you for that I I'dlike to actually open this up to thewhole panel because I think this is areally important question what what aresome of the barriers that we're going toneed to overcome to really realize theopportunities that Sylvia just talkedabout as we think about AI being used inresearch education and patient care whowants tostart I'll open it up this timewill start with youso I'll I'll again plant a phrase inyour thinking uh we want to drink chairesponsibly what I mean by that I misseda bunch of buzzwords uh so love chai uhso so responsibly comes from our raiseedhealth initiative which is uhresponsible AI for safe and EquitableHealth um and uh chai stands for theCoalition for health Ai and all of thisis that I mean it's a massive area ofactivity right now we have not muchregulation immense potential lots ofcorporate greed and a responsibility toget it right uh and so how do wenavigate all of this andso here we have a process that Nataliementioned a while back called a firmassessment Fair useful reliable modelslooking at the societal issues lookingat the Ripple effects of using a modeland the point is to think beyond themodel let's look at the workflow impacton the humans impact on the patientslike our Workforce humans our ourcustomers so to speak or people whowe're serving impact on the IT staff onthe nursing staff so we look at all ofthose implications and then sort by riskand complexity and that's sort of ourfirst Approach at being responsible inthis process of navigating thispotential sort of chaotic field ofmultiple Solutions competing for ourattention thank you nigan Natalie yourthoughts on barriers I'm gonna gonna addalways the again the Pediatric and andmaternal perspective but um you knowthinking about um again same kind ofConcepts uh but then thinking about theadditional limitations we might havewhen we are dealing with much smallerdata sets uh and uh partly becausechildren are usually healthy thankfullyum but again much smaller data sets andthis extra layer of Regulation thatmight be around incorporating thoseincorporating that data uh and thinkingabout um uh and then thinking about thechallenges that happen again with thekind of pediatric Guardian model sothere are multiple different layers thatmake it a little bit more challenging tosay how do we make sure thatthat um that AI is is appropriatelybeing used in these settings to add toit especially in Pediatricsis children change dramatically fromthat premature neonate to a young adultright and so it's not just Pediatricsmaybe you know the entire age Spectrummay may need multiple differentalgorithms I think um uh there's there'shope in that a lot of the great workthat's being done um in adults can beapplied to children and so we've seensome great examples Scott SAS did thedid a study of the Apple heart Apple umwatch on on detecting arhythmia inchildren using the same adult rhythmiaand showing that it can be veryeffective in Pediatrics but that workneeds to be done in order to determinewhich ones can be used and then you knowthere's this idea of is it applicable isit a fair algorithm and then there'salso how do you use it that can thendetermine whether it is fair or not umand so the the one example that'scommonly used um and this is notpediatric specific spefic but uh is thatis algorithms that are used to detectwhen somebody might no show um and ifyou use that and then overbook thatcould lead to disparities in care rightbut if you use that no-show algorithmand realize that these might be peoplethat need more support and children andfamilies and complex situations oftenfall into that category then you canreach out proactively and support thatpatient and family to get to care and sothe application of the algorithm whetheror not it is inherently biased can havesignificant effects that's a greatexample Natalie David your thoughts onbarriers um in a way I just want totouch on something that both of the umjust mentioned which is first the roleof interest and recognizing that thechallenges to really implementing thisis recognizing that the algorithms arenot neutral they embody interests thatdifferent people have the famous exampleover Meyer's work talking whichdemonstrated um bias against blackpatients in its application about whowould get Social Work benefits It's Madesound like there was just a mistake inthinking that cost was a proxy forhealthcare it was not a mistakeHealthcare Systems care about cost soidentifying interests and especiallyinterests of commercial entities iscritically important to being able tofigure out how to have anything thatwill be remotely responsible andEquitable going forward um and then theum some of the things that you justmentioned about some of the ways inwhich we can protect by identifying andshaking those things out and doing thisresponsibly and developing the toolswhich I know Nigam has been at theForefront of developing um I think thoseare going to be critical for this toturn into the opportunity to switch itaround from being something that'snegative to something that's positivebecause in the end AI is often just amirror that that reflects you know ourdata reflects the social determinance ofHealth it reflects biases in physicianbehavior and that can be a problembecause the models that we then use thatlearn from that data can either reifythose problems or they could be turnedaround in the way that you suggested toreally be a way to highlight thosethings and combat the problems thatactually already exist thanks David I Ilove that that uh quote AI is a mirrorlet's we take that with us I I love thatSylvia your thoughts onbarriers I have to say I love that quoteas well AI is a mirror because it's afunction of the data that we'vecollected and it may be biased and it'shelping us recognize those biases umI'll change it a little bit and talk alittle bit maybe about the techn ologyright now and we use especially thesegenerative AI tools we know that theyare the quintessential blackbox we don'treally know how they're working and thatis very unsettling if we're going toapply these in a clinical or biomedicalcontext so we have to continue to workon making these tools explainableunderstanding why are they giving us theanswers that they're giving what arethey indexing on and also pushing themfurther as we have with traditional AItools and having them tell us howcertain they are of the answer thatthey're giving us we can and and so thisis a very exciting time even on thetechnology development side thanks syviauh one of the barriers I think about ischange management it's not specific toAI it's it's basically in every projectthat we do but if you think about it umwe all need to be educated on thepotential of AI and what it can do andwhat it can't doand where the limitations are so thatwhen we see the results say of somethinggenerated for us we understand how muchto trust it and how much that we need toverify it and so I think it's really allof our responsibilities to beresponsible humans as we think aboutusing responsible Ai and so all of usworking together and really thinkingabout how do we how do we harness thepower of this how do we evaluate it howdo we understand its potential but alsorisk is going to be really importantwhich leads us to next question David AIis a tool it can be used for good orevil what keeps you up uh at night interms of what could go wrong with thistechnology and how do we get ahead of itwell sure the example that we heard alittle while ago about how the value ofusing AI tools to help withpharmaceutical development soundsawesome and a couple of researchersworking in this area attending abiocurity conference published a paperthat got everybody uh sort of concernedwhen they realize by tweak tweakingtheir model instead of like avoiding badside effects maximize them and by justtweaking their model they realized thatthey could build a fantastic bioweaponsdesign Factory um and so in fact theynot only were able to uh using that toolum essentially design no well-knownselect agents they realized there are alot of uh nasty things that they wereable to develop that nobody knows aboutyet and they didn't publish that andthey didn't publish the details of theirmodel but I don't know how hard it'sgoing to be to really redo the model andto do that other researchers working ontoxicity with similar kinds of modelsare finding the same thing and mostscary in a article in nature machineintelligence a couple of chemicalEngineers from here said you know it'sum um there's a lot of guidance for howto avoid issues around equity andthere's a lot of literature on that wehave no idea what we're supposed to doabout finding out that like our workcould be used by nefarious actors forterrible terrible purposes um same istrue for you know the great things thatwe could do with ambient technologycould be used by state actors oremployers to to monitor people and theirbehaviors and in ways that we reallywould find objectionable so that dualuse I think is really challenging andit's one where our current regulatorysystem and IRB review of research justdoesn't address at all I'm hoping ourESR processes can start to lead tointernalization of thinking about thoseissues and mitigation strategies butthat's what keeps me up at night isthinking about those things yeah wellnow I'm going to be up at night too sothank you for that GL no I I think it'sa really great Point um you know AI isprobably going to be fighting AI in thefuture and so we're going to have toreally you know be in front of this andagain it goes back to us understandingthe potential so that we can we can stayin front all right so I'd love to turnit over to questions from our audiencewe'll start with a virtual question buteverybody in the room we're going tocome to an inperson question next sohopefully one of you has a question ifraise your hand we'll get a mic to youbut um first question is what is youropinion on the future of DiagnosticRadiology as AI makes advances in thefield do you think there'll ever be apoint that AI will take over who wantsto take that one I think we just quoteKurt landlock right yeah is it Kurt theone who said radi AI won't replaceRadiologists Radiologists who use AIwill replace Radiologists who don't umand I think that's really you know whatwe're talking about here there's there'sso much more to providing care than justuh than just with AI can Prov and so Ithink it's important that we all learnto use it but not worried about peoplenot worried about positions who losing ajob anytime soon yeah I agree with thatI think that's a that's a great answerand always great to quoteKurt all right we have okay we have aquestion in the audience hold on we'llget you a microphone just so everybodycan hearyou for those of you who are old enoughto remember the internet revolution inthe 1990s and now we in this decade withthe AI Evolution what uh parallels whatthe pitfalls what the hopes and dreamsyou see for this decade when this newthing Blossom and flourish and maybecrash orwhatever it's a great question syia yeahI I think it's a great analogy Becausethe Internet gave us access to so muchinformation at literally our fingertipsbut what we have with these AI modelsnow is that they're connecting the dotsbetween all that information for us andso what excites me about tools that helpus connect dots that humans cannotconnect because it's such a big scale isthat specifically in the context ofmedicine the promise of molecularmedicine is closer because we can bringa lot of the basic science measurementsthat we do on really deep molecularassays on human bios specimens andtissues really in a clinical context andreally integrate that understanding inways that we haven't been able to dobefore because I see AI is reallyconnectingdots I I think there's another importantlesson to learn from that uh I was at aa meeting at NIH um gosh uh in 20 musthave been around 2019 2018 wheresomebody who was one of the bigAdvocates of open data and who' been aone of the leaders in sort of the itspace said you know I've been advocatingfor this I'm going to continue advocatefor it but I think when we were allthinking about the internet and howgreat it was information wants to befree it's going to be great didn'tanticipate Bad actors really using it tohijack elections and so I think one ofthe things that I would say that we'velearned is having a completelyunregulated space where we didn'tforesee all the different possibilitiesand the possible misuses led to somesignificant challenges and problemsmisinformation the potential destructionof Civil Society seems like a bad onebut um uh uh but lots of unforeseenthings that have really been verydetrimental to society that came out andpeople were not did not think about thatin advance so my hope is that we are notgoing to follow that same pattern ofjust saying that this is great andeverything's going to be fine and we'rejust going to just see what happens Ithink we need to be ve much moreproactive with this revolution than wewere for the last one yeah great lessonsthere uh we're going to go to a questionfrom our virtual audience uh this is T Natalie aside from Clinical decisionsupport how if at all do you envision AIcontributing to improved patientssafety so um so one example uh is justhelping us make sense of the data thatwe get so we um we get one of the waysthat we find out about patient safetyissues is through incident reportingwhere anybody who sees an incident thathappens in the hospital or sees apotential like a near Miss in thehospital can report it in our incidentuh in our incident reporting toolunfortunately those are all free textand and very hard to make sense of andso you can get you know tons and tons ofthese reports uh and somebody has to gothrough read them all and try to findpatterns and group them Well turns outgen is very very good at that um so weare already using using Genai in severaldifferent areas to comb through all ofour incident reports find patterns andthen help us develop interventionsthanks Natalie N I think the largesteffect is going to be indirect so mostsafety issues can be traced back to lackof attention which is usually because oflack of time and beingdistracted and if this technology trulyfrees Us in terms of our cognitiveburden uh that will be an indirect andperhaps the most meaningful advancementtowards increasing patient safetygreat points uh audience question ohwe've got a bunch now okay whoever getsthe mic first we should like throw themic like that all right I think we haveover hereokay thank you all um I think it's areally interesting conversation and uhas an engineer I find it reallyfascinating um the question I had wasaround um the responsibility oforganizations and uh The Wider communityon collection of data and the securityaround that as we um you know as as theopportunities and the benefits of AIstart tomaterialize and people in the Public'sperception and confidence with thistechnology increases how do you thinkthe trend will change with respect topeople's um appetite for collection ofdata specifically medical data and whatdo you think the risks are in terms ofdata security and information securityaround that thank you that'sgreat who would like to take that allright so I'll take a very sort ofphilosophical stance on thisU everybody wants the learning HealthSystem everybody wants personalizedmedicine that cannot happen until wefigure out effective ways to share dataif I want to benefit from your data itis my duty to share mine like that isthe moral basis of why we have to figureout learning from large amounts of colleitive medical data but then the questionbecomes how there is privacy there issecurity there is do you even have therights to learn from it soownership andthen like it or not it's usuallysomebody'sincentive and we kind of lump all thesefour under one privacy and I thinkthat's a mistake so if you want to makemeaningful Advance we got to startteasing these apart and flip thequestion question on its head to ask howcan we find ways to share data to learnfrom as opposed to should we share datato learn from yeah thankyou yeah I mean definitely agree and Ithink it's you know it's not only ourindividual patient data and thinkingabout how can we do it and and uh and beand protect privacy but then also howcan we share data you know as auniversity as a research center asindustry um especially as we uh createthese data the create these data poolsand you you've been leading this butcreate these data pools and uh and labelthem if we can share that second layerof metadata on top of the primary datathat helps everybody move forward tooand I think Stanford has been leadingthis type of work and can continue tolead but these are conversations that weneed to push forward yeah thank you it'sgives me an opportunity to put in myplug for cyber security and datasecurity so thank you for this this is acollaborative thing we need everybody'shelp to protect our environment um andso uh it's a great point we have to makesure the data is secure and there's newtechnologies coming too to help ussecure data and share data in new waysthat increases privacy so I'm reallyexcited about kind of the technologiesthat are that are enabling us to do thisbut again when we all think about cyberand privacy and protecting data that'ssomething we all have to do at Stanfordmedicine and I could always use yourhelp so thank you thank you for bringingthat piece up uh we're going to go toanother virtual and then we'll doanother one in person uh this is toDavid how can discrimination and bias bepre uh prevented in AI specifically asit relates to healthcare yeah that's ahard one um uh that's why I gave it toyou yeahthanks uh so obviously as I've alreadymentioned the the the biases andphysician behavior are built ininterests that might lead todiscrimination are there the socialdeterminants of Health are I don't likecalling them biases because they're notbiases they're they're actual factsabout the world that we live in ifyou're poor if you're black you're lesslikely to be healthy you're more likelyto have a bunch of comorbidities thoseare just our facts and so there aredifferent tools and different approachespeople have to sort of see how thingsshake out to try and correct for some ofthose errors there's some tools that Imean Nigam and can probably talk aboutthis better than I can about ways oftrying to identify problems that emergedearlier as a way of developing it butit's important to note that noteverything is going to be solved um bybeing able to fix recognition of howPrejudice May out be the outcome of theuse of these things for the socialhealth I mean uh so uh Sarah alorn at atHopkins has an algorithm for predict forbetter much better predicting thanPhysicians are about which patients willbenefit from paliative radiation byliving a couple of years versus oneswhere you want to send them into youknow hospice soon because they're goingto die um and because of the socialdeterments of Health that first categoryis much more likely to have poor peopleand people of color than the other groupbut you're not helping people who arelikely to die to give them large dosesof radiation so I think to some extentwhat we can do is hope to use this toreally shine a light on the fact that alot of the problems that we're likely tosee are a function of societal issuesand that if we're going to fix them it'swhere there sometimes where we can fixthe algorithm in the OBM example we canmake the algorithms better they're goingto be times where we can and you'vealready heard some examples where we canput our thumb on the scale to makethings more Equitable but ultimatelySociety has to change if we're reallygoing to get all the way there n yesthank you D I think for the people inthe audience here and Stanford medicineour community three things anytimesomebody mentions Ai and machinelearning or what have you ask about thedata it's trained on ask about thealgorithm and ask about the action auser is expected or not expected to takeas a result of that and then ask for allthree are there any systematicdifferences in the data wecollected in the output of the algorithmand in the actions and their benefit asthey will acre to people belonging todifferent subgroups like literally makea table three rows two columns uh and ifthere is a systematic difference in anyof these three the data the algorithmand the action you're going to havebiases inequity all sorts of problems tothe extent we can find these things isthe extent to which we can mitigate itat least in our work thank you questionfrom the audience oh righthere uh my question is for um Dr Nigamum so we all have that um Can AI or analgorithm be writtento catch the flaws or the misses byphysicians like okay I go for coloscopyand it's uh the colonoscopist justmisses a a small pop and can we write analgorithm that the colonoscope itselfrecognizes that hey there is um a smallpop which you have missed or uh I go forradi radiotherapy and then theradiologist doesn't U do a physicalexamination of after each um uhradiotherapy for the cancer patient umor of surgeon post surgery doesn't do uhuh postop uhexamination of the own can this bechecked in current state not throughdata or through retrogressively so a lotof the examples you mentioned can beum it won't be one solution that doesall of them uh the only solution thatdoes all of them is a vet neural netseven layers which is in everybody'sheads uh the the artificial neural Netsyou need to train them for a particularthing uh even these large models youknow the the multi-trillion parametermodels you apply them to detect a popversus detect a delayed healing woundyou still have to adapt them or trainthem for that purpose um how far are wefrom being able to doeverything many years how far are wefrom being able to do the top 50 thingsthat we are failing to do for examplefailing to follow up with anincidentally found lung nodule probablytwo years so I think the problem is moreabout prioritization what are theproblems we're going to take on firstyeah thank you we have a great questionum from the audience how do we ensurethat the people being impacted by AIhave a say in its development and one ofthe examples are electronic healthrecords and you know how there probablywere opportunities in the beginning tohave them be more um provider focused uhbut curious what the panel thinks aboutthat so there's lots of differentanswers to this but one just kind ofspeaking to that that example uh is theevolution of of the field of medicineand and the new skills that thatclinicians are being taught and so umone of my other roles is programdirector for the clinical informaticsFellowship for Physicians uh and thatjust became a new field back in 20122011 uh and we now have the oldest andlargest Fellowship in the nation wherewe have Physicianswho are then doing an extra two yearslearning about clinical informatics andare very actively involved in the designand applications of AI right now and sothat's just one example of ways to getthe people who will be impacted involvedin thedesign wow I interpreted that questioncompletely differently um so I mean Ithink the people impacted ultimately arepatients yeah and so um uh and I thinkwe do a terrible job of having patientsinvolved in governance and and of whatdecisions are made uh there's a lot ofwork going on in community engagement alot of new tools and approaches incommunity engagement I think we need todo a much better job of bringing thepublic in and in a way it's it'sinteresting because I completely agreewith Nigam about the uh importance ofthe learning health system andrecognizing we don't have any problemabout saying look if you're in the ICUtrainees are going to be involved inyour care if you want to if you come toStanford this is just you knowindividual learning is a part ofhealthcare we should accept that grouplearning is a part of healthcare thedifference is it is transparent in thein the case of individual learning itsays on people's name tags they're aremedical student they are resident itsays very clearly what their role is andwhat their level is on the East Coastusually tell by the length of theirwhite coats but anyway um but but it'snot transparent so I don't think we haveto have consent because that will makethe data useless in practice but we needtransparency we need transparency weneed accountability so that when we saywe're going to use your data we actuallydeliver on the things that matter topeople um and those are the things thatI think really really matter trans haveif we have more transparency if we havemore accountability um that will allowan an active engagement to the publicthose three things are going to be thekey to any successful learning healthsystem and that's been argued by Ruthfeden and ncy Cass and others that thosethree are really critical if we'rereally going to make this system workthank you that's really wonderful uh Ithink do we have time for one morequestion over here first of all I wantto thank you all um for being in such adifficult but important space andspecifically I want to thank you for theEpic inbox management because that's thebane of my existence and I can't wait umI also just got back from doing an AIpanel for Northern CaliforniaPsychiatric Society the regional branchof the American Psychiatric associationand I did not choose this but themembership asked for ethics of AI and sosome of the things that they're mostscared about is generative Ai andwhether there will be a watermark andand I know you mentioned there's notcurrently legislation for um for AIgenerated content to then be fed intothe training data and then cause youknow more inequity by having the Normsbe norm and um and then Equity gettinguh worse and worse um so that that wasone of the big concerns and was to beable to lean into that another was thatthe um that that the ethos of SiliconValley has long been move fast and breakthingsbut we're talking about people and andinequities in healthcare Martin LutherKing said are the most inhumane of allbecause they involve life and death so Iguess it's less of a question and moreof a challenge for you all to with theinformation you have with the direct andand compassionate concerns that you haveto lean into the legislation lean intoleading um people who maybe don't wantto hear because it's it's difficult umbut that's why it's important rightthank you for that comment reallyappreciate that um we still have timefor some more questions so um get aquestion from our audience uh what kindof relationships are being built withindustry partners and startups so I'llactually take this one um you know thisis such an exciting time I mean we'rewe're sitting in Silicon Valley everystartup has AI in their title um and sothere's a ton of stuff out there youknow when I think about partnering I Ithink about it in two different ways oneis there are platforms so these arethese are technologies that we can dolots of things on and whether they'reideas that we come up with and put intothe platform or things that come withthe platform that that really gives usan opportunity to partner at a very highlevel so I'll give you an example aplatform may be our electronic healthrecord um we can do lots in it we canintegrate a lot of things in it so itreally is a robust platform uh thesecond is when you have a very uniquekind of problem that a startup companyis trying to solve and if those problemsmatch up if we have that problem and wehave a startup that maybe can solve thatthen we'll get together but one of themost important things is what is themotivation of the startup because if wedeploy something that's going to be uhtouching our patients then we don't wantthat startup to be you know sold toanother company and then shut down intwo years and that happens a lot sowe're very careful when we look atpartnering to make sure that thecompanies really in it for the rightreasons and that we're going to be ableto leverage that technology for forquite some time and it's going to besupported I think one of the things tounderstand is each model or eachalgorithm that we put out there has tobe monitored someone's got to watch itbecause they can drift they can dounpredictable things we talked aboutdata data can change how we collect dataso we have to learn and understand howdo we kind of monitor these things atscale and that might be okay for 2030but when you start getting to hundredsthat's a real Challenge and so part ofthe thing that we're all going to needto work together on is making sure thatwe kind of oversee the AI algorithms andhow they perform over time so um we gotanother panel question for everybodyhere lightning round um why should wefeel optimistic about what's to comewithAI maybe we should start with Davidbecause David you talked a little bitabout the evil stuff let's talk aboutthe good stuff yeah it runs against mynature my pessimistic natureso uh but I'll be honest the thing thatmakes me most optimistic is actually thework of people like the people up hereon this panel I'm really impressed bythe fact that Nigam who's I I what makesme sleep better at night you know I whatMak keeps me up at night is knowing thatNigam is is playing this major rolehelping to implement AI in the HealthCare system and that he cares deeplyabout the potential pitfalls the ethicsof this we didn't really talk about itor highlight that but he's got you knowdanc and char who's a bioethicist hereand uh as well as a physician and umMichelle Melo who's a lawyer andethicist both work with him as part ofhis efforts and everything that he doesI I'm just so impressed by the fact thatum all of these different folks arereally they care deeply about the equityissues they care deeply about the impactthey care deeply about doing the rightthing if if every place the problem is Ithink not stanfords so I'm optimisticabout academic medical centers at leastsome of them and I'm optimistic aboutStanford doing goodwhat makes me more nervous are whathappens in the smaller hospitals andphysician practices which where alreadythey have lots of drug detailing andother kinds of things that areproblematic going on that's where Iworry but I think the the hopefullythings will trickle down from Stanfordto other places and that's what makes meoptimistic thank you David we we'llwe'll go to Nigam and then Natalie andsyvia Nigam has our cure for insomniawhat do you have to sayon I mean the the primary reason to haveoptimism is that the alternative doesn'tgive you too many avenues forAction if you approach the problem withan optimistic Bend you can devise thingsyou can do we can do that would allow usto shape the future in the way we wantum pessimism doesn't offer thatopportunities I choose to beoptimismNatalie uh I just I think I'm so excitedjust by the incredible resources andpeople that we have engaged across theentire University across stord medicineuh and you know again with my myPediatric and obstetric lens um beingable to bring the resources that we haveto bear at Stanford medicine childrensin partnership with all of these otherincredible resources to make sure thatwe have appropriate applications acrossthe age bedroom thanks Natalie and syvialast word um so I'm incrediblyoptimistic because I do feel like we areon the precipice of new knowledge and weare truly on the best campus to makethat happen you know not only do we havethe fantas ftic Medical Center and amedical school but we have an entireUniversity that's within walkingdistance and we connect every day withour colleagues um from engineeringHumanities and Sciences lot all theschools all the seven schools integratearound this so I I derrive a lot ofoptimism for that knowing that we are inthis really integrated campus that'sreally looking together really at thefuture of AI and um and so for all thereasons that we're said here I do thinkwe're going to also derive new Knowledgefrom these tools it's going to reallyimprove the health and well-being of ofall of us thank you Sylvia I'd love tothank our esteemed panelists if we givethem a round ofapplause thankyou you know this was really a wonderfuldiscussion but it's just the beginningthere's going to be so many moreopportunities to engage throughoutStanford medicine on AI and it really isabout bringing all of your voicestogether to make us better and that'swhat I'm really optimistic about um Iencourage you to stay engaged um you canregister for the raise Health Symposiumwhich is going to occur on May 14th aswell as sign up for the raise Healthnewsletter so you can keep in the knowabout responsible AI thank you all fortaking the time to be with us today wereally appreciate that you did not sendyour AI avatars here so thank you andhave a wonderful rest of theday all rightgoodjob</td>

convinced you how phenomenal itis to have Dr carck in the room with usand throughout the day today I will justsay to you as a colleague and really umdearcollaborator I know you are in for ahuge Tri today as Dr carnik talks aboutthe future of Child and AdolescentPsychiatry digital Mental Health Data Aiand mobile tools please welcome Dr carikthanksMarina so with all those titles itbasically means I don't get a lot done II rely on a lot of other people to helpme um I might move around a little bitso people can hear me with thismicrophone it's okay all right umall right I before I get into thesubstance of my talk I like to do thissometimes and so I'd like to know howmany of you have at least one device onyour person right now that connects theinternet can you raise your hands howmany of you have two so just keep yourhands up if the others can drop it howmany you havethreefour all right so three seems like we wewe hit our our Max that's our realitynow and and it's really interesting tome I mean right now I am functionally alike a cyborg type of person herebecause I have not only my smartphone inmy pocket I have an Apple Watch on meI'm wearing an ultra human ring which iskind of like an aura ring I have acontinuous glucose monitor on my armthese things are all driving tons ofdata into our cloud-based systems intomy phone which then connects to all thisit is unending in terms of this and wehave to also accept the reality thatmuch as all of us are connected in hereour adolescence and young adults areeven more so so take this as a given youknow when in yourpractice um I'm fortunate that all ofyou fund my research thank you very muchum so I'm going to start with a littlebit of on mental and Behavioral Healthin terms of how I see the field broadlygoing and then I'm going to focus focuson a couple areas so if we think aboutchild analysis and Psychiatry I thinkthis to some degree reflects thetraditional structure um those of youyou know who practice in the space youknow will say you know we have impatientwe have outpatient we do a lot of workin schools and community based settingsum there is a great deal of researchhappening within child psychiatry wecould certainly use more and I would saygoing back sometime there has been abranch of child psychiatry that has donesome degree of population healththis is going to change in the comingyears and is already underway to changefirst um we are going to start to getmuch more of what I'd say our intensivePsychotherapy interventions so by this Imean we are moving away in many areas inthe adult world and those trials are nowstarting to seed into the Adolescentworld away from the models of weeklyPsychotherapy to MK treatment and Idon't know if any of you have had representations here on mass treatmentsbut you know one one of my uh menteeshas been doing trials where they'redoing PTSD treatment with cognitiveprocessing therapy in as little as aweek you know two sessions a day for aweek with gains retained out to a year Imean that type of approach is reallyInnovative and and actually I think willbecome more common within uh thePsychotherapy World second I'm going tospend some time you know today talkingabout our mobile and Technologysolutions that are coming into thespace third we have a lot of uh EHRdriven so our electronic health recordsdriven um uh interventions and researchand screenings that are happening andI'm going to present in that space aswell um but other things to think aboutthat I just wanted to put out there arelay driven interventions uh there are anumber of Trials going on uh in use ofof lay people or or community healthworkers who are first line Psychotherapyinter ions healpopulation and finally um I put on hereinfusion treatments and neuromodulationuh these are now happening to a gooddegree within the adult space the trialsfor these within adolescent space needto happen and they will happen in in insome short period of time uh already weare seeing TMS you know for foradolescence and teens being used um butI think a lot of the uh infusiontreatments that are being used in adultswill have to be trial in adolescence aswell so today I'm going to focus onthese two domains uh in terms of theseuh areas where child psychiatry isgoing so by way of sort of level settingand you have in the audience uh expertsin substance use so I I apologize tothat Carmen sorry I'm going to review alittle bit about uh substance use justreally quickly so those of you whoaren't familiar with it uh might be uhso this is um some old data but it'sstill relevant these are Hazard ratesfor age of onset and back then DSM 4when this was done um by Comptoncolleagues uh for alcohol Dr abuse anddependence but basically what you seehere is this you know the Peaks on theseare in um the the late so it's allstarting in this adolescent period muchas we see the effects as adultssubstance use fundamentally begins inthe Adolescent period and we have toaccept that if we're going to come upwith a better prevention strategy andand perhaps modify some of ourinterventions this is more recent dataon mortality now you may have read insome of the literature NPR ran somestories New York Times ran stories abouthow we have seen this remarkabledecrease in opioidmortality and this is this is hearteningand true but just prior to those uhPublications coming out we were seeingthese spikes here so this is large dueto elicit fenals and synthetics um andthis is all among adolescence all rightuh so this mortality rate continues thethese are some of the pockets that weknow uh minoritized populations are arestill not seeing the benefits of ThisGlobal decrease in mortality andAdolescence are still not seeing it andand you can see here which uh uhminority groups among the adolescenceare most affected so our our tribalNations are being affected um and ourblack population actually is not asaffected in the Adolescent range but inthe adult range it's all the way up atthe top and here we see latinxpopulation as well so we need targetedinterventions this is um older data onthe prevalence of substance useddisorders for adolescent users and it'sshown by uh ethnic minorities and um andwhat you see here is that um basicallythe Native AmericanYouth and uh black uh youth uh have someof the higher rates in this so again weneed to think about this as we moveforward uh this is that same data justshown numerically but I don't reallywant to spend too much time on this andthis is um this is from monitoring thefuture this this survey is done uh andthis shows you know the generaldecreases actually amongst the you knowdifferent grades in terms of uh illicitdrug use the this is good news this isactually very good news for us we don'tknow if this is going to be sustainedbecause as you can see this is the timeperiod just where you know covid uh youknow um intervened so we don't know ifthis is a temporary uh effect or not I'mgoing to show you some other data thatshows that actually it probably was atemporary effect and that these numbersare likely when monitoring the futurenext iteration comes it's going to go upagain um so all of this data comes fromour traditional approaches to data youknow we do surveys we we you know try tomake these surveys as representative aspossible these surveys are largelyself-report there are lots oflimitations in this first of alladolescent are hard to study you have toget access to them you have to getconsent there are difficulties sometimesin reporting this data because of fearsabout the implications for it most ofour survey data for adolescence is basedon school-based uh reporting in otherwords that's the place where they'remeeting these kids because that's wherekids go and you can catch them in largenumbers but children with severepsychiatric or substance use disordersare likely underrepresented in thatpopulation think about who isn't in theschool right when those surveyshappen um and you know in many caseseven if they are in school they can'tsit through a traditional class they'llbe in the special ed classes perhapsthose classes don't get surveyed inthese General approaches and there'salso some thought around that there arepotential peer bias effects when you doyou know hand out a survey to a wholeclassroom and they're all sitting nextto one another even though they havesome degree of privacy in completing itthere can still be some effect in thatcohort um there are household surveysthat try to do this but again there youhave the parent effect then right theparent is usually present it's not likethe interviewer is interviewing theyoung person in dependent of the parentsitting there so the best data actuallyin this space probably are point in timeestimates these are often used forunderrepresented populations we do ahomelessness uh point in time estimatesthose are really good but youth areoften underrepresented in those setbecause youth aren't necessarily in thesame settings as those so you can see ineach of these traditional approachesthere are difficulties and in and andchallenges with the data in aggregatethey're probably all useful right andI'm not saying you should neglect thisdata at all I'm just saying that thereare caveats on all of this so one of thethings that we tried to do to get abetter handle on this is we decided tolook at the national trends foradolescent hospitalization of substanceuse so this is really a big dataapproach this is one of the areas wherewe use uh the power of of artificialintelligence in its most simplisticmanner to gather data so we pulled 20million Encounters of pediatric patientsso this is uh what electronic healthrecord system do you guys use here is itepic yeah so your data is in this okayso epic has the cosmos data set this isa broad data set that is a um you knowlimited use data set they try their bestto De identify the data but your data isactually part of this and um we lookedat uh over 200,000 encounters that wereattributed to substance use we alsolooked at the other psychiatric issuesbut that data is still they're workingon that the team still running theanalyses on that and what we found wasthat substance use encounters uh weremore often among uh White and NativeAmerican populations in thisdata um in the 13 to 17 year old rangeit was more common um and interestinglyuh in this relative to other indicesfemales were more represented and urbanpopulations were more representedunsurprisingly social vulnerabilityindex those with uh low um socialemotional vulnerability had higher umsubstanceuse and this is a little hard to see sosorry but this shows you the studyperiod so what we did was we broke thedata up into three periods this is thetotal study period here and then thethree periods are the pre-pandemicperiod so 2017 to 2019 the pandemicperiod which we just Define Is 2020 eventhough March 2020 is really the thebeginning Point um and then thepost-pandemic period and then if youlook across all of these what you see isyou know there were um Rises so onething to keep in mind is these areproportions that we're showing you herethe overall hospitalization rate for forchildren pediatric hospitals saw adecrease in hospitalizations overall butif you look at substance used as aproportion of the hospital ations yousaw a rise across all substances uhessentially except for opioids and umand even these small differences hereare significant because of the overallsize of the data set and then it largelyreturned to normal in the post-pandemicperiod with the exception of cannabisthat is the one thing that willconstantly stick out here foradolescence and we're not sure we'retrying to do the analyses now as towhether that is a function of the kindof moving wave of legalization that'sgoing on in the country so my team hasactually divided the country intodifferent uh domains around likecannabis use where it is still illegalwhere it is uh legalized you know insome form for like medical use whereit's legalized for recreational use andthose three domains and we're trying toanalyze the same data to look at whetherthat correlates with this or not becausethere's there's varied reporting in thepolicy literature on this so overall wesaw decreases in hospitalization duringthe pandemic period and then the otherthing we don't know with this is what'sthe causal factor for these rises in themiddle is it because these kids had moreaccess to drugs seems unlikely becausethey were mostly at home and doing a lotof them were doing homeschool is itbecause they were hospitalized becausethey were observed using by theirparents who then bring them in wherewhereas when you had the general Schoolcontext they could use with a little bitmore you know uh protection from adultobservation right so it's it's unclearthe D this data doesn't tell us thestory behind it it just shows us aneffect so this is the same data shown ingraphical form in essence with the threeuh periods as the different bars hereum so here we were looking at thedifferent uh racial and ethnic groupsand and you see here some of the trendsI was pointing to um you know that wehad the the Native American Youth werethe most affected overall and um andthen some of the other groups had loweramounts um and um we looked at ruralrural you know communities versus urbancommunities and um and then there's thegender analysis so not a lot ofsurprises in any of this in terms of thefindings um but this was really drivenby the volume of the data this isn'tpublished yet we're still kind of workon the paper and get it togetherum so the males had slight decreases sothat's that was different than thefemalepopulation andum older youth uh it's like de increasesfrom pre-pandemic to post-pandemic butagain those it's hard to interpret thisdata because of the overall trend changeit's hard to look at the absolutenumbers in this uh type of data becauseCosmos reflects all uh instances of Epicacross the country and so then thehospitals that use epic is constantlyRising now it is the dominant player inthe EHR universe so the N is constantlyin motion over the same time period uhyou see broaderadoption so some of the disparities weresubstance specific if we look at alcoholum we saw the native Hawaiian PacificIslander population the Hispanicpopulation uh showed showed increasesthere and then in marijuana it was malesand opioids some risks around uh for theHispanic population so we really need ahealth disparities approach a really weprobably need more of an intersectionalapproach that takes into account thedifferent elements of of minoritized umpopulations in this and how they cometogether so you can imagine when westart putting like a a rural versusUrban mix on this you see even morevulnerable youth right the minoritizedyouth who are in rural locations aremore likely to be atrisk all right I'm gonna pause there fora moment and ask if there are any briefquestions on that data before I move tothe nexttopic we can come back to all of thistogether at the end as wellwell okay I'm not seeing anythingpressing so for some time now I've beenworking on uh with youth experiencinghomelessness andum this population has been of interestto me just because these are some of theyoung people who I feel are mostvulnerable and and they're they'revulnerable for a number of reasons youknow they have chronic trauma exposureoften a combination of physical sexualand emotional trauma they're at highrisk for substance use disorders in factthat's how I came into being in thefield of substance use was by doingclinical work with youth experiencinghomelessness if you'd ask me when I wasin training and when I was doing myfellowship whether I was going to dosubstance use research I would have saidno and then I ended up working inshelters where almost all the youth hadsubstance use problems and then so I hadto learn how to do substance usetreatment and and that's what brought meinto this space um a lot of these youthare are at risk for HIV um secondary toabuse or or prostitution often that'sSurvival sex that they're involved inthey also have secondary effects um fromearly drug exposure there are a smallnumber of studies that have looked atthis that they have had in uteroexposure to substances which thenaffects their cognitive abilities theyhave the effects of violence you knowdomestic violence interpersonal violenceCommunity violence it's all around themand they have mental health difficultieswith limited access tocare so when I work worked here I workedat at Lin Street here in San Franciscouh for for a couple years when I wasfinishing my training and you know myfellowship and then I I I stayed hereactually I was at UCSF for part of mytime in you know attending in the psychofarm clinic right after fellowship andthat's when I used to go over to LenStreet and um one of the things Ilearned was these youth have been somany of them have had such negativeexperiences with the mental healthsystem my uh the the the team that wasworking with me uh and the supervisorsthere told me don't pull yourprescription pad out doc we don't wantyou to do any prescribing really we justwant you to be around and give theseyoung people a positive experience withwith a mental health professional so Iliterally for some of my time I wasactually sitting in one of the you knowdropin centers at at Lin Street on acouch in the middle of this room andpeople be coming by and sometimes they'dstop and talk and that was part of mytime there it was it was really eyopening it and so from that was born ourfirst study on on um on youthexperiencing homelessness um and webasically did a you know anepidemiological study with the miniInternational Neuropsychiatric interviewum this this sample of 116 is acombination of like my data when I washere at UCSF Len Street data and thensome data from Chicago so we just pullthe data across two shelters um and whatyou see here which surprised me was thatI thought I would see a lot ofpost-traumatic stress disorder actuallywasn't very high um which to a degreereflects the resilience of thispopulation and their ability to you knownot have that developed and most of themactually the mood symptoms andsuicidality were predominant now thissuicidality is a little bit inflatedbecause those of you who are familiarwith the mini will know that if yourespond with um hopelessnessthat is actually a trigger on the minifor a positive suicidality screen and alot of these young people due to theircircumstances indicated that feeling soI would say that a lot of them had somemild suicidality the the number of casesof acute suicidality where we had totake action during our assessments wasrelatively low I think I can count twoinstances where we had to come up withsome type of safety intervention andthen you see you know substance use isis here you know in terms of but nottremendously High um but but presentglobally and and some of this is thatthey just don't meet the DSM criteriayou know but they're still using youknow quite a bit and then this getsneglected here and I I'm sorry we won'tget to talk to Daniel because you knowthis is something that when we were bothat University of Chicago together we weI I I talked to him about that this thisyou know to what extent is this A copingmechanism under stressful conditionsso that study then led us to our ourfirst intervention study we werestarting to take the knowledge that wegained a lot of it very formativeKnowledge from from some of the youngpeople that we talk to and uh we had ayouth Advisory board that came up withthe name for the study they called itstepping stone the idea being it was astepping stone to treatment they weren'tready for treatment but they were goingto start so we gave all the participantsa smartphone um we purchased them andjust gave them a smartphone we pre- loedthe smartphone with three mental healthapps developed by uh the Center forBehavioral intervention Technologies atNorthwestern so this is David Moore'sgroup he had already developed these andwe just thought it better to take themoff the shelf they called them pockethelper purple chill and Slumber timethey're all based on CBT principles umyou know relaxation uh insomnia andgeneralCBT we gave them a service and data planfor up to six months that was perhapsthe most valuable thing we gave themactually because a lot of them actuallyhad smartphones but they didn't haveservice plans they couldn't maintainthose because of the cost and we alsogave them in the beginning a month ofsupport from a therapist so we had apsychology postto who sort of Manning aa dashboard and could get in touch withthese folks and they could schedule upto three 30 minute phone sessions withwith the postto and they could alsocontact the postto by by phone and textand um so this is what the pocket helperlooked like this is one of the apps umthey got a daily tip um and the tip uhwas something around you know from drawnfrom CBT principles they were asked tojust rate the tip and then they werealso given a a daily stress evaluationasked to rate that and if they did theseconsistently for two weeks at a timethey would get um a little like a giftcard kind of beam to their phone youknow that they could use in their Googlewallet and um you know this this issometimes how the tip would show youknow with a little image and there werea whole lot of other apps that theycould use on there if they wanted tothis is a how the therapist dashboardlooked so therapists would you know getthe reports from them when they wereawake when they were sleeping you knowtheir duration they were kind of a lotof that was computed for them and thenthey would kind of click and and verifyon their phone if that seemed accurateum their stress number you know based onthat little scale the lyer scale Ishowed you and then they could write intheir biggest challenge you know in inthe in the text field and let thetherapistknow so this is how our um flow was uh45 youth 35 were deemed eligible uh wegot valid response on 28 a good numberof them actually did all three sessionswhich surprised us given how hard it isto track some of these youth but um andwe we got 23 you know at the end interms of valid completion uh of thesurveysso these were the outcomes um ofthis combined therapist and AP driveninterventions um basically no change inall this I actually one of the thingsyou'll see today is I'm really good atnegative trials okay so this was anegative trial and um when I presentedthis to some colleagues who also workwith youth experien at homelessness Ipresented this to some of the folks atthe shelter in Chicago some of the staffthere they actually said that no no thisis actually pretty good I was like whatdo you mean this is good they said wellthey didn't get worse I said what do youmean they said and they told mebasically look you're dealing with apopulation that's under constant stressthat's often exposed to constantviolence and Trauma and the fact thatthey didn't get worse might be anindication that your interventionactually worked I was like well itdidn't prove that you know they werelike well you got to design a study nowto look at that and see if that's truethat's a hard study to design but um wedid find some other things in this datathat were interesting so we weregathering not only one of the reasonswhy we wanted to give them unlimited umdata was that we wanted to actuallypassively get all the data from theirphones now we consented them to this andwe actually have a published paper wherewe have the qualitative data where wewent through this whole thing with themthis exercise with them that we wantedall their data from their phones andthey asked us why and we said well wewant to try and develop someinterventions and some ways to helpother young people like you we said okaythey saidwell Google and apple aretaking all the data anyway so we mightas well give it to you because we knowwho you are so um so some of the data wegot was all their geolocation data andum and their Wi-Fi usage data and um weeven know which apps they use on thephone and we have all the textual datafrom their phones um and the interestingthing with this is that um there was acorrelation between so David Moore hadfound in adults um that there was acorrelation between depression andgeolocation people who had moredepressive symptoms moved less largelyfrom their homes their their circle ofof movement is is small and and it's ameasure of entropy is what's used to tolook at this and as their um phq9 scoresdropped and they got better their theirmovement Circle increased so ourquestion was was this true for apopulation that doesn't have a home andfor a younger population and it turnsout it's true this this data actuallywith the psq9 here shows that to be trueand I won't go through the details ofthe entropy normalized entropy because Imean I need my statistician to explainall that but suffice it to say herepeated what David Moore did in termsof the analysis and found that that wasto be true and we had to Define what acluster was so distances in this workare different depending on on where youlive different cities have differentmappings Los Angeles is much more spreadout than San Francisco so whatconstitutes a geolocation should bedefined differently and then if youstart looking at suburban and ruralareas the metric changes right so youhave to kind of think about that in allthis it's not these these kind of andthere's no precedence in the researchliterature on how to do these analysisso you kind of just have to come up withyour best guess in terms of doing thisbut the interesting finding was that wealso found that this Dynamic was truefor this population and we think thatthey were kind of hunkering down ineither the shelter or in other placesthat they thought were safe and that wastrue for depression and it was also truefor trauma like PTSD symptoms on thepcl5 so that was the novel Finding inthis paper was that um geolocation canbe a good predictor of this and you canstart to imagine that our phone startsto become a proxy for our U mood andaffc thenright and in some ways from atherapeutic standpoint it might actuallybe better for us to have that continuousmeasure rather than using surveymeasures all the time the phone may knowyou're depressed or having PTSD symptomsbefore even you do based on how you moveso stepping stone one led to SteppingStone two so I did this whole series ofstudies I did with Allison ZTA andStephen Schuler um who are now in the UCsystem just down in Irvine um and uhStephen actually he he gets credit forgetting this study funded because he waspresenting some of our work on steppingstone one at a conference in Illinoisand somebody from the state of Illinoiscame up to him and said we have sometechnology money from samama you knowcould you expand your study and he saidsure So they gave us money for hundredphones so then we were like okay we gotto do some more on this study so instepping Zone 2 we took the therapistout because you know we didn't see theclinical effect in terms of what wewanted to see in in on that element ofit so we thought what if we just kind oftake a step back and just let it be afully automated intervention so we gavethem the phones again and uh wepreloaded with 14 mental health apps andwe chose all the apps that we could findout there that were available like lotsof different tools not just the onesthat Northwestern had developed um andone app was even developed by a groupcalled The Young invincibles uh forhomeless youth in Chicago they hadpreviously come to me and asked me aboutadvice onwhat they were working on and I toldthem at the time I said to them I saidwell I said one of the challenges I seewhen I talk to youth is it's hard forthem to know where the beds are in thecity and um I said and in Chicago we hadjust like had the divvy bikes you knowuh all deployed and I said you know Ican go on the divvy app and I know thatthere's a bike available here and I knowthere's a slot available there I saidwhy can't we have the same thing for umyou know youth beds in Chicagoso they built it I it was stunning to methat they were able to do it but theydid and so all those apps were kind ofput on their devices um before they gotthem andthen so this is some of the results ofthat at three and six months and you cansee there's a huge attrition in thisstudy we had we start with a 100 a threeMonon follow we only had like half ofthat population and then six months itgets even smaller it's hard to keepthese young people in the study they'reeven moving around the country not justthat they're moving around Chicago butthese are all the different apps and anduh access points that they had so umthose daily surveys I showed you thatthat asked them about their mood um andtheir stress level um they like those sothe more green and blue you see thatmeans they like it they really likethose it was really kind of surprisingto us they also like those daily um thethe tips so so the survey was askingthem about their stress and the tips wasa CBT tip which they raided with thelittle star system those were the twomost popular things across these twotime points they hated anything wherethey had to deal with a human they didnot like Coco so Coco is actually anonline texting uh platform to itactually has a little AI component to itbut the if you if you express anydistress it pushes you to talk to ahuman Illinois warmline that's like ourlike you know um General helpl line forthe state they did not want to talk toanyone that that got panned even crisistext line didn't wasn't popular becausethey were have to engage with a personthere they wanted things that werereally low threshold and they liked howfast these things were they didn't wantto spend a lot of time on this the dailysurveys they told us kind of gave them amoment of self-reflection which theyreallylikedum I'm going to get to the key lessonslater so I'm going to go through thisnext study is um the Step Up test upstudy so all of this work with the youthexperiencing homelessness kind of led usto you know a different clinical trialwe were trying to think about how do wetake this automated approach and bringthis to the area of substance use youknow for highly vulnerable population soa lot of the young people in Chicago Iwas working with were young men who sexwith men young transgender women sothese were the two populations and naidaissued like a RFA to say you know wewant we'd like some Technology basedinterventions to address substance usein this population so we designed thisrandomized control trial I did this withRob Galo um and Lisa Coons at lurryChildren's Hospital and we deployed thisat HIV testing sites across the city andfollowup was at three six and 12 monthsand this was a fully automated screeningso was just all on a tablet you did ascreening and then there was a briefmotivational interviewing interventionthat was built as a series of slidesthat looked something like this was alittle bit dull this was this washigh-tech at the time when we designedit and you know by the time we got donewith the study you know we we were likeoh my God we could have made it so muchbetter if we had the technology toolsnow I told you I was really good innegative trials so here's another one umbasically um we didn't see any effectand we we use alcohol as our majoroutcome in this because alcohol was theCommon Thread across all these youtheven though we tracked all thesubstances alcohol was the one that wasthe trigger so we didn't see any bigdifference in number of drinksum days of drinking kind of you know uhactually went down more for the controlpopulation than the interventionpopulation um so there wasn't a wholelot of effect we did see a little bit ofeffect um intermittent in in themidpoint of the study a three-month timeperiod on on risky sexual behavior butlargely negative trial didn't didn't doanything all rightthen this is a little bit onum How We Do addiction screen so thateven though that screening worked theintervention didn't so then I said okaywe can take this screening and do sometype of screening you know in thehospital maybe we can catch populationsand treat them in the hospital withhumans right so rather than having anautomated uh intervention we just havethe a screening in this case it was amanual screening and manual interventionso this is an addiction console servicebasically and I don't know do you haveone here at UCSF an addiction consoleservice kmen do you know yeah there isone okay so very similar so weestablished this at at our Hospital inChicago and in the first year we screen87% of the population with one or twoquestions so there one question aboutalcohol one question about um Generaldrug use if you answered yes to eitherquestion the alcohol question led to theaudit the substance use question led totheD um so when we did this you knownursing was doing the first twoquestions nurses on average we were toldat the time when we deployed this askabout 500 questions of a patient atadmission so anytime you want to addquestions to that it's a huge ordeal sojust getting those two little questionsin there was a big accomplishment butthey weren't they were optionalquestions in other words if they werepressed they could skip them but wetrained the staff and we got 87% to dothose first two questions um in thesecond year we dropped down to 73% sothat was a little bit due to lack ofongoing training and probably staffturnover right nurses go and take otherjobs everywhere and you know move on andthen new nurses and we hadn't had enoughresources to train the new cohorts asconsistently we hadit an online modulebut not the live training that we haddone originally and then covid happenedso um we had this like going over twoyears 2018 2019 and then 2020 covid andthey shut our screen down in the middleof Co in Chicago under what they calledsurgedocumentation so the hospital RussiaUniversity Hospital where I was at umthey actually had the capability ofchanging all their general medicine bedsinto ICU beds so the hospitalfunctionally became an ICU for um a longperiod of time in you know for severalmonths and and accepted the vastmajority of ICU cases in state ofIllinoiswhen they turned it back on ourscreening rate had dropped to 40%surprise surprise so no one was doing itthen and we basically then decided oneof my trainees um then maid abar wasworking on an artificial intelligencetool to screen for substance use so hesaid instead of doing the manualscreening which you know is optional whydon't you just run this algorithm in thebackground and let it screen thepatients and then you can have the teamdo the intervention so it sounds goodthe rationale being that 80 90% of ourcharts are narrative charts so you haveto use something like natural languageprocessing to get this data beforenatural language processing this datawas inaccessible in some form and nowyou know because it's not like a bloodpressure or a result on a lab test it'snot a fixed number so or a fixed valueso the current machine learning methodslet let us get into this and this isanother venue through which I got intodata science so we validated it at ourHospital found that it worked worked wedid it against our um D and audit andsaid you know test it out it works foropioids we saw that there were differentsubtypes of patients in this populationso in the population with screeningthere was like a subtype for painpatients there was a subtype for traumavictim patients you know who wereengaged in violence in the communitythose were often young black men whowere engaged in violence who would gethurt and then be taking some opioids orthey were taking periods when they gothurt and then they were coming into thehospital so there were like fivedifferent phenotypes in there you couldstart to imagine actually doingdifferent interventions for thosedifferent subtypes of ofpatients there were also disparities inthis data the the look the the thealgorithm learns on language produced byhumans there is bias and stigma in ourlanguage all over our charts so thealgorithm learns some of that and that'sa problem and we have to figure out howto address that problem we haven't comeup with the solution but my new centerthis is this is kind of like what droveus towards establishing the new Centerfocus on HealthEquity we did do bias assessments nowthe bias assessments we're usingrelatively crude tools from myperspective even though this is all highlevel machine learning the the tool thatwe use to do the bias assessment from myperspective is basically doing a fancykite squar on this data and a Kai Squaretest is good but it isn't getting to thefundamentals of the of this it's justcomparing you know uh rates ofpresentation against what it wouldsuppose is there but it doesn't have anyground truth behind that necessarily sothere are a lot of challenges in thiswork first um we have large volins ofdata being generate every day so allthese different domains I showed you arejust tests of some of these differentdata approaches right and as I told youin the beginning like we are allfunctionally little Dusty data cloudsthat are producing data all the timethese data are not harmonized ortranslatable across platforms in otherwords our phones do not really talk toour EHR which doesn't really talk to ourproviders in any functional sense um itit it retains our data it doesn't helpus with the data um we have devices thatwe use for work and for school none ofthese things kind of connect in anyuseful way from a health careperspective we do have ehrs we also havephysiology data and genetic data lots ofpeople sent their da their samples to 23and me there's data out there for thembut none of those things are necessarilyconnected the data is too much right thevolume of the data I don't really wantto know how many steps my patients takeon a daily basis and see all that data Ineed data reduction and datavisualization to understand that dataand we don't have good ways to displaythat data yet and there's also minimalattention to disparities and disquiacross the data and in the use of thedata and and in access to their owndata so what is this going to look likeum as we move forward so 40 years agoum you know you would go to your doctormaybe and doctor would give you phq9maybe back then I think a few placesmight have done it maybe in Kaiser umand they might say your phq is elevatedyou know are are there any issues thatmight be causing it and patient says youknow young man says well I'm not surebut I have a lot of work at school youknow and and you know let's just monitorit and you know maybe get some lab andsee how you're doing right that might bea typical answer today you prob have thesubstant really the same conversationeven though your patient has lots ofdata and tools that have relevant dataabout depression inthem and our providers have lots oftools but again as I mentioned thesethings aren't really communicating intools you know doctor has their Applewatch too and none of it you know reallyconnectsum the doctor might add a littlesomething here you know the patientsaying my my my watch been advising meto move more doesn't it tell you that doyour Apple watches tell you to stand upall the time I've still got that set onmine it tells me that all the time itreally aggravating when it told me thaton a plane flight you know that was 15hours it's telling me to stand up I'mlike where um you can also you know thetherapist now might might you knowmention that you can connect to atherapist on an app right Doctor onDemand there are a number of differentplatforms to to try itwith but if we start to think morebroadly about this data right our phonesand our watches have lots of data comingat us from different perspectives sopelaton people recognize that one UberEats useful to know probably for some ofour patients what they're eating andordering it's all in there this one isum lose it which is basically my fitnesspal same type of thing uh tracks whatyou eat tracks what you um do in termsof um weight management this is myfavorite one this is Rover I don't evenknow if this one still exists but I liketo keep it on here do you know Roveryeah so Rover tracks your dog okay andthat ends up being a proxy for people sopeople with active dogs tend to beactive themselves and that's importantthat's actually really valuable data andprobably one of the better motivatorseven among our youth experiencinghomelessness Eric Rice Who's down at USCdid a nice study where he showed um howmany young people in his sample had dogswho were homeless and how important thatyou know animal was for them so all ofthis is there right and so in the futureif we can pull that data together we canstart to do uh predictions because a lotof what we do in terms of what'senvironmental what is biological changeshow we think about our interventionsright the more biological interventionswe might tend towards medicationinterventions to try and amarate themthe more environmental ones we might tryand do some individual work and somefamily work and behavioral work rightand so what we really need to know is weneed these apps to help guide us on thistrajectory you know is is it moreenvironmental or is it more biologicaland if so how does that help us choosethe right treatment with some Precisionfor the right population and to me thisalso ultimately becomes an equityintervention if we think about aPrecision approach we really will haveto acknowledge bias and dise equities inour system system and bias and diseequities in our data and this starts tobecome a way to balance that and to tryto address that because you starting todo this at the individual level so II'll I'll kind of end here with thisthis is these are plots of realtime datafrom that geolocation data in the youthexperiencing homelessness um study Imentioned and what you see here arethese three young people and thesearen't the real young people you know wewe just kind of put some images on thembut this data tells us a lot about theirmovement in the city so this this issomeone who I I had high phq9 scoreswasn't moving around a lot was kind ofisolating to a certaingeography these actually end up beinginteresting so on on on the far righthere you see this one does anybody knowwhat this is here inChicago can you make thatoutsorry yeah is the L line so this is theblue line that goes out to oare this isactually really common for homelesspopulation Chicago to ride the Blue Linebecause the blue line um basically goesyou know end to end it goes all the wayout to O'Hare and then they can rideback out and especially when it's coldoutside that it ends up being a nicewarm place and generally the the folksat the airport don't bother you knowfolks who are just kind of quietlyriding the L Line This one is also showsCTA lines so they bus lines in here sothis person's in motion and moving tellsus a lot actually and and we really needthat to help us better understand ourfunctioning of our adolescence and ouryoung people their whole story is kindof in their devices and and increasinglyit's a dynamic between their devices andthe cloud and you know they they work inthat space they connect with each otherin that space and we have been slow toengage them in that space I mean Marinayou were working in that that space Iknow your team has been working in thatspace But I think generally as apractice and as as as providers we don'tyet have the tools to actually intervenein that space and that's where weactually have to start to think aboutmore broadly how how can we leveragethat because that will bring us to themrather than trying to get themconstantly to come to our office I meanthat was the lesson with my youthexperiencing homelessness they weren'tready to come to my office that theyjust weren't at that point so it wasimportant to try to figure out how canwe engage them where they are and allthis variety of tools has some potentialto help us with that so I'm going tostop there I think I'm pretty close ontime and I'm going to take somequestions from from folksum I just a a a thought about I don'tknow how good you can get later datalike the study where you didn't find aneffect across time right there's plentyof data on trauma and yeah fearExtinction right that you don'trecognize it during adolescence rightit's really an effect but you whateverever will see that effect versus controlon adults I mean is can you do you thinkyou can meet up with these people againwith from this study probably not youknow that that probably you know verydifficult to track them down I mean oneof the interesting things in some of thephone data has been you know how oftenwe used to see people actually movingaround the country so I didn't show youany of that Geo data but we actually hadpeople who you know you know were movingNorth and South is actually thecorridors around youth experiencinghomelessness in the US so from SanFrancisco I I know that a lot of theyoung people at Lin Street you know whenit gets colder up here even it doesn'tget cold cold it gets cold enough thatit's hard to be out outside right theygo down to Los Angeles or San Diego andthen they would come back and in Chicagoit's it's actually the corridor down toNew Orleans so occasionally we would seethese these lines that go there butbeyond that um hard hard to track thatnecessarily but I would love and one ofthe things I've been talking to one ofmy colleagues Robin Mermelstein whoMarina knows Robin and I are trying toset up um you know a center Grant wherewe wanted to do a couple cohorts andfollow cohorts over time and so one ofthe cohorts I'd like to construct is ayouth experiencing homelessness cohortthat we could follow longer term andthen try to test different interventionsthat might work for themso with the scale of data you cancollect with the ahr and the devices youknow how do you think about separatingstatistical significance from Clinicalsignificance good question um I thinkthe the you know the the EHR data isnecessarily dirty in some ways it's acrew data right so I don't know if itgives us a lot of necessarily clinicalsignificance it gives us more of apicture of what might be happeningespecially for things like covid it'suseful you know to kind of see thatTrend because it takes place over alarger scale right now my team isactually trying to dig a little bit intothat Cosmos data to start looking at umCosmos data and we're also usingn3c um which is the national co uhregistry because we want to see theeffect of long covid on adolescence sofor those purposes we we'll be able toget more clinical so the kind of FirstTake gives us that broader View and thenit lets us refine the questions thatmight get more clinical becauseadolescence and long Co is we don't wedon't have any data to guide us we knowwhat's happening in adults and a lot ofthe effort and research funding is goinginto that population understandablybecause there there has been much moreeffect there even though the Adolescentcohort is small I suspect that there isstill U probably a signal thereyeah thanks so much for reallyfascinatingpresentation I have to confess I'm onlywearing one device and so tomorrow I'llprobably put on another just to try tostay up with the trend um I'm I'mcurious U you know lots of interestinguh approaches to data that are availableand um lots of uh applications ofavailable apps but what apps U digitalapps have you pushed into to igr um inclinical practice that you you think areyou know ready ready to go well to datewe haven't pushed any specific apps intoigr um you know there there's a host ofthem so we're we're actually initiallyright now moving into using uhtechnology to screen so I've gotten themto start moving away from the bask notthat the Basque is a bad tool it's justtime intensive to hand it out and thento score it so um we actually arestarting to use uh Robert given'splatform um and and the cadh platformand and deploying that because um thatgets us to the answer faster and youknow his his approach is is nice in thatway are are folks familiar with with hisplatform at all um he has a version foryouth yeah he he has progressively builtit so he designed it initially foradults so it uses um item responseTheory so he has a bank of questionsthat sit in the cloud and he has testedthese questions on large psychiatricpopulations to do assessments and sowhen you use his platform it doesn't askthe same questions it's kind of like thethe versions of the SAT where it asksyou a set of questions and then based onyour answer it tracks you into you knowdifferent categories so this person islooking more like depression or thisperson's looking more like anxiety basedon your initial questions and then itasks you more specific questions inthose domains and he's developed thismethod so in in in as little as 10questions it can come up with arelatively high probability diagnosisnow researchers don't like his toolbecause it's not the same questionsevery time right but in some ways itactually is efficient from a clinicalstandpoint it also avoids like testretest bias they're not seeing the samequestions every time his his hisplatform has actually been used in someof the infusion clinical trials wherethey have to do assessments every hourso you can't give someone the phq everyhour and expect you know to havereliable answers but his platform can dothat so we started with that um I'm kindof holding out still on the apps becauseum you know apps come apps go and andour academic apps have not had a greattrack record um and I am is actuallystarting to say like don't send usanymore app proposals right so the onesthat I'm finding most interesting Jimare the ones that are uh games sothere's a there's a handful right nowand and sorry when we design games asacademics they're they're boring sorrythey're really bad but when the gamedesign people got interested in mentalhealth that's where we're starting toget some really cool tools so the theone I saw that I I I I've given a lot ofthought to because I like it it it was agame for um uh anxiety in young kids andum and what it does is it it it itactually has a little bit of likeneurophysiological feedback to it sowhen you first see it it's kind of likeit shows you kind of like dark shadowsin a room and as you lower your anxietythis light starts to kind of open it upand then you see that these Shadows areactually like a lampshade or or a acouch or a chair and and and it goesback and forth so if your if your heartrate goes up then it starts to get alittle darker so it's it's it'sencouraging the child and and you knowuse therapeutically you'd have to sitthere with the young person initiallyand help them kind of calm themselvesright and it shows you know somethingthat's an important lesson that we allhave to learn right we don't see thingsthe same way when we're stressed or infear as we do when we're calm right andthat for for for some kids you know whohave fear of the dark could certainly bea useful tool and I and it was sobeautifully designed you know theinterface was really elegant and and youknow the the reality of thesesimulations is dramatic um I when I wasdoing veterans work um you know someyears ago I I saw some of thesimulations that they were using youknow the VR simulations that BarbaraRoth bomb's team Emory had designedthose were amazing I mean you know andand we put a older vet who's a a Vietnamvet you know who who's a a prettydistinguished therapist in Chicago StanM Kraken he he got into one of these youknow VR things and I mean it literallyshaking him like the the device actuallyshakes you as you're kind of goingthrough like a simulated fua amazingstuff so I think we're getting close butI don't think we're ready for prime timeyet yeah in the backMichelle has to get her steps onthere I hope you have a tracker foryou're astair hi um I imagine this is apopulation with severely disrupted sleepand I'm curious if any of the devices orapps that you've used have proxymeasures of sleep and just knowing thatcan be a low stigma Target forintervention um if if that data areavailable and to what extent itcorrelates with um substance use or anyof the other mental health greatquestion um Allison's all and I when westarted designing these this series ofstudies we actually thought we weregoing to Target sleep we that wasactually the initial thing that wethought would be most because a lot ofthese young people when they're in theshelter they're in group situations andgroup settings where it can be hard toget sleep you know young people allaround right but when we did our initialwork with the population they said no noyes sleep is a problem but that's notwhat we want your help with they wantedmuch more like life skills and coachingand how to get along with other peoplethose were their priorities so wepivoted based on their feedback we didget some measures of sleep and and oneof the apps that in in that set that wedid on both the first and second studyis like Slumber time uh which is an icbtintervention so we had a little bit onthat but not a whole lot but but you'reyou're right we we thought exactly thesame way you did and and we were kind ofturned away fromthat well thank you everyone and specialthank you to Dr caret thank you so muchfor having me thanks thank you for beingwith us</td>

      <td>good morning also from my behalf so I amJohanna Kalo and today I'm going to talkabout digital behavior-based stressdetection in a real World Knowledge workcontext and this kind of speaking to anaudience is a common stress test inexperimentalpsychology uh however if it's shorttermandcontrollable uh it's part of life andthe stress actually helps us us copingwith the challengingsituations so the stress that I'mexperiencing at the moment can actuallyhelpme uh work rated stress is on the otherhand societalchallenges prolonged stress is a a bigproblem in modern society for example60% of the European employees are expering experiencing high levels of workrated stress causing ill health andmillions of lost workdays uh in my presentation uh stressrefers to an imbalance between theperceived demands and the perceivedresources and the individual's abilityto goope with thosedemands uh prolonged stress has anegative impact also so onproductivity because stress increaseshealth issues and sicknessabsences uh typically stressed peoplework a longer days and their performancemaydrop uh stress may also cause changes inan employees behavior and socialinteractions uh quite common causes forwork stress include time pressure highworkload interruptions and poorcommunication but in Finland uhoccupational health and safety law saysthatemployers need to prevent harmfulworkloads and in my opinion this kind ofcontinuous stress monitoring can helphere uh when employers want to know howtheir employees are doing they usuallyusually use different types ofwell-being measures like surveys orinterviews those are really good ways tocheck on people uh but they are noteffective for continuous well-beingmonitoring also the impact of differenttypes of support actions May remainunclear because of long measurementintervals uh as a response to thischallenge sensor-based stress detectiontechnology has become an active researchtopiccontinous stress uh monitoring uh andcontributing factors at theorganizational level uh could help contcompanies to better manage harmfulstress to dat the mo most uh stressdetection Studies have been conducted inconstraint settings which are focusingon the short-term effects of inducedstress such are arithmetic tests or thiskind of speakingevents uh on the other hand in real lifework stress varies because of differentwork task and psychosocial and physphysicalfactors uh trans transitioning researchto real world settings is quiteessential but uh accurate stressdetection has severalchallenges first there's no absolutemeasurement scale for stress and groundrot is really challenging toevaluate on the other hand uh supervisedartificial intelligence and machinelearning methods need ground rootlabels uh ground root labels can beobserv notes measured biomarkers suchour cortisol level self reports ordifferent types of situationalinformation for example stressrelaxation phases in laboratorystudies um in long-term and real lifedata collections participants typicallyprovide these self reports but even thisis not easy because of response fatigueso typically we get uh like labels forone week but after that the number oflabels isreducing uh one more challenge is thatbehavioral data are distinct to everypersonand because of this person specificlearning typically produce produces bestoutputs so in our recent study calledmat at work BT collaborated with finisInstitute of Occupational Health weactually collected real life computerusage data and self-reported stressperceptions from over 70 individuals fortwo to fivemonths for data collection we usedsoftware which was installed on personalcomputers and it CED only privacy savedata such as speed of mouse movementsMouse clicking Tempo or typing Tempothis software did not collect any anycontents like data on key strokes oropenWindows uh then during the mat at workwe developed machine learning and sensordatabased Technologies to automaticallydetect pursued stress and also a tool tovisualize the stress while preservingprivacy uh based on previous researcheswe know that stress can be detectedthrough changes in behavior and thesechanges can be like uh uh alteredcomputer usage patterns or longerworkinghours in our case study using thismattered work data set our Focus was ondeveloping machine learning algorithmsto analyze individual most movements anddetect changes in behavior that indicatestress um this approach models normalbehavior by establish using average umMouse patterns for each features suchare the number of mouse clicks uhtrajectory curvature or distance fromstart toend uh on the right side this figureillustrates uh what the data looklike uh because of challenges inreceiving these ground truth labels Imean self reports for the participantswe have been experimenting with thesmall number of labels to decide uhwhich features are effective for eachindividual we used uh an unsupervisedmachine learning method and personspecific learning for classifyingStressless and stressful conditions andwith this metwork data set we manage toachieve 72% average accuracy fordetecting stress on daily basis and 80%average accuracy for three Monon longperiods so in a sense uh this measurescontinuously but it's not a real time ina sense that you can say in every minutehow stressed the person actuallyis and next I will show you how theanalyzed data could beutilized to understand whether employeeswould accept continuous stressmonitoring at the workplace we conductedan internet survey among Europeanknowledge workers and based on over12200 responses the workers would acceptcollecting digital Behavior data forworkplace well-being purposes if privacyis preserved So based on this survey thePrivacy is one of the most criticalfactorshere we also developed an organizationbarometer which is a concept forvisualizing measured sensor based stressdata at the organizational level in amanner that uh respects privacy andethics the parameter shows onlyAnonymous and aggregated data meaningthat no identifiable data fromIndividual employees arestored as a part of our research we alsotested different visualization metaphorsour aim was to find effective andpositive ways to report stress statusand reasons for it and based on theco-creation process we found out thatthe V forecasts would be arepresentative way to visualize stressrelated information and increase thiskind of informationcomprehension uh you can see thebarometer figure on the right andthere's this ultimate sun whichillustrates cumulative stressful andpositive days at theorganization uh yellow days are positiveand and these blue days are showing thestressful days so this visualizes thestress detection results based on onmattered work data set using uh thismouse usagedata second uh the provided self reportscan be used to illustrate the potentialstresses such are Interruption timepressures high workload and so on andthose are showed in the rightcorner also this parameter can showlong-term data for example data from onemonth to six months which can be used toestimate the impact of the providedwell-being actions or changes in theworkworkpl so uh the presented mat at workstudy experimented with the new ways toassess perceived stress continuously byusing machine learning and real lifedigital Behaviordata uh our case study result suggestedthat stress can be detectedautomatically from Mouse usage patternsand in principle employees are oemployees are okay with digital Behaviordata being collected for well beingpurposes but privacy management iscriticalhere uh there was a audience questionabout the time frame for real lifedeployment and this proposal the stressdetection solution could be applicablewithin three to four year timeframe however before this kind ofoperational deployment the reliabilityand validity need furtherevaluation uh it is good to note thatour results are based on data less than80persons it is also essential to considerthat continuous stress monitoring in theworkplaces must be voluntaryand employees own day theirdata there's also another question onhow we could tackle the issue of privacyfor highly sensitive uh objective andsubjective data sets that are used forassessment of mentalhealth this is actually a importantissue and relates to my data and datasovereigntyprinciples in our approach the startingpoint has been that the individual ownshis or her data and the organizationallevel analysis cannot identify anyindividuals uh the solutions are quiteTechnical and without going into thedetails here one potential approach isdata spaces initiative from EU which isabout uh trusted dat data sharingbetweenorganizations uh in this model uh datacan be utilized without actually movingit from theowner but then anonymity is not part ofdata spaces architecture but VT istaking part in this initiative and wewill explore if it could be leveragedsomehow to be part of thesolution I also want to highlight thatthe AI act regulates the use of AI inworkplaces and for example emotionalrecognition is not allowed unless formedical and safetyreasons whether stress status isemotional data is another questions uhquestion and that needs furtherinvestigation I don't currently have aclear answer forthat all also uh using AI systems needtransparency especially when employeesare interacting with an AI basedsystem on the other hand the safetylegislation says that employers must tryto prevent harmfulworkload and uh continuous sensor basedassessment of stress levels and relatedrisk factors at the organizationallevels espe in knowledge work where wehave our mental strain could help compcompanies to detect harmful workloadsand improvesafety so that was my my talk and uh ifyou have any questions I'm I'm happy toanswer</td>
